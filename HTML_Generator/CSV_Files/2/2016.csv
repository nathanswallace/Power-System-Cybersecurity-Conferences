Das; S. Santoso,"Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, USA",2016 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition (T&D),20160725,2016,,,1,5,"Event reports recorded by digital relays and other intelligent electronic devices provide a snapshot of the power system and contain a wealth of information. Analysis of event reports can uncover incorrect relay settings and help avoid relay misoperations. Momentary faults can be detected and repaired before they evolve into a system-wide blackout. Furthermore, system operators can use the knowledge gained from analysis of event reports to reconstruct the sequence of events, track down the location of a fault, gain insight into the root cause of the fault, and take action to prevent the same fault from occurring again. This paper analyzes a series of complex events collected from a distribution utility to emphasize the benefits of event report analysis in improving power system reliability.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-2157-4; POD:978-1-5090-2158-1,10.1109/TDC.2016.7519909,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7519909,,Circuit faults;Digital relays;Fault currents;Fault location;Mathematical model;Timing,power system reliability;relay protection,digital relays;distribution utility;electronic devices;event report analysis;power system reliability;relay event reports;relay misoperations;relay settings;system operators;system-wide blackout,,1,,,,,3-5 May 2016,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesChallenges of implementing substation hardware upgrades for NERC CIP version 5 compliance to enhance cybersecurity,J.

To supplement in-house resources, utilities rely on consultants and suppliers to meet NERC's fast approaching deadlines, such as implementing the latest NERC CIP Version 5 (V5) standards.

Yu; Jie Jiang,"EECS Dept., University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, WI, USA",2016 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition (T&D),20160725,2016,,,1,5,"Growing vandalism and terrorist activities pose great challenges to securing the modern power grid. As a practical high-impact, low-frequency threat, the attackers could simultaneously sabotage multiple critical transmission lines in a coordinated manner to initiate the cascading failure for causing great blackout. Thus, it is pressing to study the hypothesized multiple line attack strategies. In this study, the static strategy, dynamic strategy and space-pruning searching strategy are proposed for more effectively identifying the critical lines in the multiple line attack scenarios. And the optimal selection of critical lines in the multiple lines attack is determined based on the criticality of the lines, which is modeled by several mathematical indices developed from graph theory or based on enumeration. The effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies is tested using three bulk IEEE test systems. This study provides some meaningful insights about malicious attacks targeting the critical transmission lines.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-2157-4; POD:978-1-5090-2158-1,10.1109/TDC.2016.7520087,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7520087,Cyber-physical security;cascading failure;line criticality;multiple line attack;space pruning,Generators;Indexes;Load flow;Power grids;Power system faults;Power system protection;Power transmission lines,power transmission protection;search problems,critical line identification;critical line selection;critical transmission lines;dynamic strategy;hypothesized multiple line attacks;malicious attacks;multiple line attack scenarios;power systems;space-pruning searching strategy;static strategy,,,,,,,3-5 May 2016,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesPerimeter substation physical security design options for compliance with NERC CIP 014-1,B.

RAS generally take strong control actions that may prevent major blackouts. No testing method has been implemented to test the operation of such an important scheme after RAS is commissioned in the field. Development of an in-field RAS testing method requires moving data between substation and test data facility within reasonable time as well as following set of standards. Erkios is a fault-tolerant middleware framework that provides a novel method to test RAS remotely after being commissioned in the field. This paper explains the development and integration of real time testbed with Erkios to facilitate cyber-physical simulation of end-to-end in-field testing of RAS.
