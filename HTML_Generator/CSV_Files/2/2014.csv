P. Padhy; S. C. Srivastava; N. K. Verma,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India",2014 IEEE PES T&D Conference and Exposition,20140724,2014,,,1,6,"Network uncertainties, such as time-varying delays, packet losses, packet disorder, seriously deteriorate the performance and stability of any network based control system. To address this issue, a systematic approach has been suggested in this paper to compensate for the network latency in the application of synchrophasor assisted wide area control for the Static Var Compensator (SVC). The power oscillation modes are estimated online in presence of packet drop in a communication network. The modes are monitored through a modified Modified Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) approach. The time delay has been compensated by predicting the dynamics of the delayed measurement signal. A network control system model has been developed incorporating the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), event driven communication network and network buffers to mimic the response of a real time communication based control. The wide-area stabilizing controller has been designed based on Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy approach. The performance of the proposed delay compensation scheme has been tested on 39-bus New England system.",2160-8555;21608555,Electronic:978-1-4799-3656-4; POD:978-1-4799-3657-1,10.1109/TDC.2014.6863166,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863166,Extended Kalman filter;Network delay compensation;Phasor measurement unit;Power system stabilizer;Static Var Compensator;TS fuzzy controller,,,,,4,21,,,,14-17 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesImprovement of timing reliability and data transfer security of synchrophasor measurements,L. Zhan; D. Zhou; T. King; Y. Liu; E. Johannessen; J. Alexander; B. Boza,"Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of Tennessee Knoxville, USA",2014 IEEE PES T&D Conference and Exposition,20140724,2014,,,1,5,"Synchronized phasor measurements are becoming one of the key measurement elements of wide area measurement systems in advanced power system monitoring, protection, and control applications. Availability of global positioning system (GPS) provides the possibility of wide-area deployment of Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) and Frequency Disturbance Recorder (FDR) in power system. GPS is the only timing source for PMU and FDR so far, and they will cease to work when GPS signal is lost or unstable. In addition, phasor data is transferred over the Internet without any encryption, which exposes data to cyber-attacks. The purpose of this paper is to develop an alternative GPS independent timing synchronization method for PMU and FDR, and to implement an encryption system without disrupting real-time data delivery. Primary test results confirm improvement of timing reliability and data transfer security of synchrophasor measurements.",2160-8555;21608555,Electronic:978-1-4799-3656-4; POD:978-1-4799-3657-1,10.1109/TDC.2014.6863270,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863270,Cyber security;FDR;GPS;PMU;Synchrophasor;eLoran,,,,,5,20,,,,14-17 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesUsing distributed intelligence and wireless communication to control and coordinate multiple capacitor banks,M. Ibrahim; M. M. A. Salama,"Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, N2L 3G1",2014 IEEE PES T&D Conference and Exposition,20140724,2014,,,1,5,"Switched shunt capacitor banks are commonly used in distribution networks to reduce the system losses and support the voltage. In this paper, distributed processing units equipped with wireless communication transceivers are installed on different buses (nodes) of distribution system, and are used to control and coordinate multiple capacitor banks in order to maximize the distribution system loss reduction. Real-time information from the smart meters, e.g. measured active and reactive load powers, are utilized by the distributed processing units to perform real-time distributed load flow analysis. The resulting voltage profile and current flow in each branch are used to iteratively compute the switched capacitor banks states that maximize the system loss reduction. The Network Simulator NS-3 is used to co-simulate the proposed capacitor banks control scheme along with the wireless communication network. The distributed load flow analysis and the the proposed control scheme are implemented as C++ applications within the network simulator NS-3, and a WiMAX wireless communication network is used in the co-simulation. The percentile rank of the computed capacitor banks state, which is obtained from NS-3 co-simulation, is used to compare the performance of the proposed control and coordination algorithm to the optimal state which obtained from GNU-Octave exhaustive search.",2160-8555;21608555,Electronic:978-1-4799-3656-4; POD:978-1-4799-3657-1,10.1109/TDC.2014.6863287,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863287,,,,,,1,14,,,,14-17 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesCyber security applied to P&C IEDs,J.

The normal operation of UPFC is dependent on both its physical part and the associated cyber system. Thus malicious cyber attacks may impact the reliability of UPFC. As more information and communication technologies are being integrated into the current power grid, more frequent occurrences of cyber attacks are possible. In this paper, the cyber architecture of UPFC is analyzed, and the possible attack scenarios are considered and discussed. Based on the interdependency of the physical part and the cyber part, an integrated reliability model for UPFC is proposed and analyzed. The impact of UPFC on the overall system reliability is examined, and it is shown that cyber attacks against UPFC may yield an adverse influence.",2160-8555;21608555,Electronic:978-1-4799-3656-4; POD:978-1-4799-3657-1,10.1109/TDC.2014.6863469,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863469,Unified power flow controller;cyber security;cyber-physical system;power system reliability,,,,,0,19,,,,14-17 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesFaults and failures in cyber-power interdependent networks,B. Falahati; Y. Fu,"Operation Technology Inc.

The cyber network is categorized as a digital communication network, so it intrinsically follows similar regulations, as well as faults and failures. A data communication system is a chain of components stretching from a data source to its destination. Like a chain, each component must accomplish its assigned tasks adequately. Nevertheless, this novel technology has introduced new groups of failures that are conceptually different from those of traditional power networks. Power system reliability studies must consider the failure modes and repair strategies of the cyber network. This paper investigates cyber-power network failures and proposes a novel, all-inclusive categorization of failures that have the potential to threaten the power system's proper operation. Microgrids and automated substations are two well-known cyber-power networks that could benefit from the proposed study.",2160-8555;21608555,Electronic:978-1-4799-3656-4; POD:978-1-4799-3657-1,10.1109/TDC.2014.6863411,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863411,cyber-power networks;failures;faults,,,,,2,17,,,,14-17 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
