Lombardi; M. Powalko; K. Rudion,"Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany",2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting,20091002,2009,,,1,6,"The increase in the amount of generators based on renewable energy sources (RES) in the power system is leading to many changes in its operation. Since the RES depends on weather conditions, coordinating the operation of the entire power system has become a more complex issue. New challenges need to be faced in order to supply the electric energy to the customers at the appropriate quality level. In this paper the concept and architecture of a complex virtual power plant (VPP) will be introduced and discussed. The focus will be paid to the optimization of the structure of the VPP as well as to its optimal operation. The result of the optimization have been presented and discussed in the paper taking into account different operation scenarios.",1932-5517;19325517,POD:978-1-4244-4241-6,10.1109/PES.2009.5275995,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5275995,Virtual Power Plant;power flow monitoring and control;renewable energy sources;synchronized measurements;system observability,Control systems;Electronic switching systems;Load flow;Medical services;Power generation;Power system control;Power system security;Power systems;Renewable energy resources;Wind forecasting,optimisation;power plants;power systems;renewable energy sources,electric energy;optimal operation;optimization;power system;renewable energy sources;virtual power plant;weather conditions,,38,14,,,,26-30 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesProtection coordination â€” An important task for network security,J.

Existing protection systems have to be analyzed and checked under higher loading and contingency conditions. Adapted protection concepts should be evaluated applied to the network. Nowadays numerical simulation tools like PSS<sup>reg</sup>SINCAL provide the possibility of a holistic simulation of network and protection behavior. This paper is presenting the results of a protection coordination study based on the proposed method. The collection of protection and network data has been done on the basis of data plausibility algorithms firstly. Numerous different network contingencies were investigated. The software assistance and the visualisation of the enormous amount of output data are described. Generic network and protection configurations leading to maloperation can be clearly found. Further on the possibility of the development of systematic solutions covering the identified practical constraints under the changing network conditions is provided.,1932-5517;19325517,POD:978-1-4244-4241-6,10.1109/PES.2009.5275790,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5275790,Protection coordination;adaptive settings;holistic simulation;network security;protection security assessment;systematic protection check-up,Automatic control;Circuit simulation;Data security;Power system analysis computing;Power system interconnection;Power system protection;Power system security;Power system simulation;Power system stability;Protective relaying,numerical analysis;power system protection;power system security,PSS SINCAL;contingency conditions;data plausibility algorithms;generic network;loading conditions;network security;numerical simulation tools;power systems protection;protection coordination,,3,5,,,,26-30 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesA novel approach for distribution system operation utilization state of the art communication technology,D.

It is spatially and temporally complex, non-convex, nonlinear and non-stationary with a lot of uncertainties. The integration of renewable energy such as wind farms, and plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles further adds complexity and challenges to the various controllers at all levels of the power grid. A lot of efforts have gone into the development of a smart grid to align the interests of the electric utilities, consumers and environmentalists. Advanced computational methods are required for planning and optimization, fast control of power system elements, processing of field data and coordination across the grid. Distributed and coordinated intelligence at all levels and across levels of the electric power grid â€” generation, transmission and distribution is inevitable if a true smart grid is to be reality. Computational intelligence (CI) is the study of adaptive mechanisms to enable or facilitate intelligent behavior in complex, uncertain and changing environments. These adaptive mechanisms include artificial and bio-inspired intelligence paradigms that exhibit an ability to learn or adapt to new situations, to generalize, abstract, discover and associate. The paradigms of CI mimic nature for solving complex problems. CI is successor of artificial intelligence and is the way of the future computing.

The system consists of load agents and switch agents located at the loads and switches in the network and a global agent located at the substation.

The German legal framework has encouraged the installation and operation of renewable energy systems and cogeneration units. As a consequence, in the city of Mannheim, Germany, more and more distributed generators feed into the distribution grid. In September 2008, more than 300 small PV systems and cogeneration units have been connected to the distribution grid, with a steadily rising number and installed capacity. The distribution grid can still host that number and capacity of distributed generation without any major integration efforts. However, to reach the above mentioned political goals, the electricity grid planners will face the challenge to integrate a much higher number of distributed generators as well as higher fluctuating capacity while maintaining and even improving reliability and security of supply. In 2007, the German government has launched the technology program ldquoE-Energyrdquo. Six research teams are currently developing new ICT infrastructures for six model regions in order to increase the efficiency of the energy system with ICT as enabling technology. This paper elaborates on the decentralized approach for a virtual power plant that researchers will apply to the city of Mannheim as one model city.

This cannot be done with the traditional PS operation. SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) is a vital infrastructure for PS. Current SCADA adaptation to accommodate the new needs of future PS does not allow to address all the requirements.
