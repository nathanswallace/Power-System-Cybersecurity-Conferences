Grijalva; A. M. Visnesky,"PowerWorld Corp., Champaign, IL, USA","IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005",20050801,2005,,,1441,1446 Vol. 2,"The increasing number of distributed and renewable generation installations has begun to affect the way bulk power systems are operated and planned. Besides energy adequacy and capacity planning, environmental aspects and economic considerations, distributed and renewable generation programs that consider the effect on the security of the transmission system are likely to increase long-term benefits. In particular, distributed generation has the potential to significantly enhance grid security if new projects are strategically located to decrease transmission flows, and reduce congestion. This paper presents a policy model capable of measuring the effect of renewable and distributed generation on grid security. The model consists of four components: a) calculation of security metrics, b) identification of beneficial locations for security, c) determination of security benefits, and d) integration with policy analysis. The method is illustrated in a sample high voltage power system.",1932-5517;19325517,Paper:0-7803-9157-8,10.1109/PES.2005.1489550,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1489550,,Capacity planning;Distributed control;Distributed power generation;Environmental economics;Power generation;Power generation economics;Power system economics;Power system modeling;Power system planning;Power system security,distributed power generation;power grids;power system planning;power system security;transmission networks,capacity planning;congestion reduction;distributed generation programs;economic considerations;environmental aspects;grid security;high voltage power system;policy analysis;renewable generation installations;transmission security benefits;transmission system security,,6,8,,,,12-16 June 2005,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesAnalysis of substation data for knowledge extraction,C. L. Hor; P. A. Crossley,"Center for Renewable Energy Syst. Technol., Loughborough Univ., UK","IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005",20050801,2005,,,656,662 Vol. 1,"The quantity and complexity of the data generated by microprocessor based relays have been enhanced beyond the immediate operational requirements. Following a serious incident, the amount of data received in a control center may be excessive and impossible to handle. The network operators have to interpret the data and rapidly apply the most appropriate remedial actions. Due to the emotional and psychological stress, they may not respond to the critical condition adequately. Any overlooks or mistakes can damage expensive power equipment or worse lead to a major blackout. Human operators are unlikely to obtain a thorough overview of an event when the amount of data is significant. What they require is useful information, not raw data. The idea is to enhance the capability of substation informatics and gain insight into the useful information (or knowledge) contained in a large and complex dataset. The paper investigates a new soft computing technique based on rough sets to extract knowledge from the large quantity of data captured by protection IEDs (intelligent electronic devices). The formulated methodology is generic and applicable to any types of transmission and distribution substations. Unlike device based data analysis such as the expert analysis of single disturbance files, the algorithm performs system wide analysis and is capable of handling data from multiple sources.",1932-5517;19325517,Paper:0-7803-9157-8,10.1109/PES.2005.1489070,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1489070,,Algorithm design and analysis;Data analysis;Data mining;Human factors;Informatics;Microprocessors;Performance analysis;Psychology;Relays;Substations,data acquisition;human factors;knowledge acquisition;relays;rough set theory;substation automation;substation protection,blackout;control center;expensive power equipment;expert analysis;human operators;intelligent electronic devices;knowledge extraction;microprocessor based relays;soft computing technique;substation data;substation informatics,,2,22,,,,12-16 June 2005,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesEffect of market structure and design on grid reliability,Z.

W. de Mello; J. A. Mayo,,"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005",20050801,2005,,,949 Vol. 1,,"Summary form only given. Virtual regional dispatch (VRD) is a method of optimizing the production of electricity and the use of electric facilities over several, independently operated control areas. VRD's presumption is that this regional optimization can be achieved, or nearly achieved, by separately optimizing each control area, and by also coordinating the transfer of energy among the control areas participating in VRD so that prices converge at the control area interfaces. This paper suggests a possible process for VRD (virtual regional dispatch). The real-time processes of both New York and New England are described in the sections that follow. Also described is a method to determine the price sensitivity of each control area to changes in energy exchanged; and use of that information to establish and predict energy exchange. Finally, an annotated time-line is provided.",1932-5517;19325517,Paper:0-7803-9157-8,10.1109/PES.2005.1489472,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1489472,,Energy exchange;Marketing and sales;Monitoring;Optimization methods;Production;Testing,control engineering computing;load dispatching;power engineering computing,New England;New York;electricity production;energy exchange;operated control areas;real-time processes;regional optimization;virtual regional dispatch,,0,,,,,16-16 June 2005,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesSecurity in restructured energy systems,F.

S. Kirschen,"Electr. Energy Syst., Manchester Univ., UK","IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005",20050801,2005,,,2200 Vol. 3,,"Power systems in industrialized countries are operated on the basis of an ""N-1"" or similar security criterion. This criterion guarantees that the system should be able to continue operating without involuntary customer interruptions in the event of the failure of any single component of the system. Incidents involving the near simultaneous failures of more than one component are deemed to have such a low probability that securing the system against their consequences is not considered worthwhile. Because catastrophic blackouts do happen in spite of the application of the N-1 criterion, one must conclude that quasi-simultaneous failures on multiple components do happen more frequently than one might think. Therefore, one should also consider whether this simple deterministic approach to power system security is still appropriate. This presentation discusses some of the issues associated with this cost/benefit approach.",1932-5517;19325517,Paper:0-7803-9157-8,10.1109/PES.2005.1489570,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1489570,,Automatic control;Control systems;Costs;Electricity supply industry;Environmental economics;Power engineering and energy;Power generation economics;Power system economics;Power system security;Stress,cost-benefit analysis;power system faults;power system reliability;power system security,catastrophic blackouts;competitive environment;continue operation;cost-benefit approach;deterministic security criteria;power system security;probabilistic security criteria;simultaneous failures,,1,,,,,12-16 June 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
