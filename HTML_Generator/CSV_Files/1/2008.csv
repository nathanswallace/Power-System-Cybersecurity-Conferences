There are methods which are developed for detecting and identifying topology errors based on the measurement residuals. However, the capability to detect and identify topology errors is related to the measurement locations and network configuration. In some cases, topology errors associated with certain branches can not be detected. The topology error detection capability can be improved by adding extra measurements at strategic locations. In this paper, this will be accomplished by using both phasor measurements and traditional measurements. It will be shown that a few extra measurements can drastically improve the capability to detect and identify topology errors in a given system.

The network security management (NSM) is used by network operators to avoid insecure network states due to high penetration of DGs.

The NSM tool introduced in this paper is performing new NSM algorithms within the power flow calculations. On the one hand, it can be used as an online application to support the network operator in his decisions using measurements and short time forecasts. On the other hand, by using the tool for long time simulations it can be used to optimize the NSM algorithms, to optimally plan network reinforcement and to predict the intensity of the NSM system on the profitability of the DG operators.",1932-5517;19325517,CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1906-7; POD:978-1-4244-1905-0,10.1109/PES.2008.4595971,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4595971,Generation Response;Network Security;Network Security Management;Power System;Power System Simulation;Remedial Measures,Distributed power generation;Energy management;Load flow;Power generation;Power measurement;Power system management;Power system security;Power system simulation;Predictive models;Wind energy generation,distribution networks;power system management;power system security,distribution systems;network security management tool;power flow calculations;power system simulator,,0,7,,,,20-24 July 2008,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesAn evaluation of network time protocol for clock synchronization in wide area measurements,Lei Wang; J.

The FNET system consists of many high dynamic precision frequency and phasor estimation devices, also known as frequency disturbance recorders (FDR). These FDRs can be used at any 110 V or 220 V wall outlet and transmit measured data remotely via the Ethernet. The FDRs can measure power system parameters including frequency, voltage, and phase angle. There are currently more than 40 FDRs placed strategically in different locations within the North America power grids to monitor the entire power network. Furthermore, the FDRs are currently synchronized in time via a GPS receiver. This paper discusses the feasibility study of the Internet timing synchronization. The motivation for Internet timing synchronization was ignited during the research for a more portable and economical yet still highly accurate FDR design. Test results are presented from several different NTP implementation methods. Based on the correlation between time synchronization and phasor accuracy, it was concluded that the current NTP is not yet a feasible synchronization tool for accurate phasor measurement.",1932-5517;19325517,CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1906-7; POD:978-1-4244-1905-0,10.1109/PES.2008.4596234,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4596234,Frequency Monitoring Network;Global Positioning System (GPS);Network Timing Protocol (NTP);Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU);Wide-Area Measurement;computer time synchronization;power system measurement,Clocks;Ethernet networks;Frequency estimation;Frequency synchronization;Internet;Monitoring;Power system dynamics;Protocols;Timing;Wide area measurements,Internet;clocks;computerised monitoring;fault diagnosis;phase estimation;power engineering computing;power system measurement;synchronisation,Ethernet;GPS receiver;Internet timing synchronization;clock synchronization;frequency disturbance recorders;frequency monitoring network;network time protocol;phasor measurement;power system dynamics;wide area measurements,,2,9,,,,20-24 July 2008,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesAn advanced security constrained OPF that produces correct market-based pricing,R.

The reliable operation of future energy supply structures with high share of distributed generation and renewable energy sources is an important and highly complex task. Supply of energy always means to find an optimal mixture of different sources. The main issues are economic effectiveness, environmental sustainability and reliability in supply. Any energy source has its own advantages and disadvantages. Over the last years the structures of electrical power supply changed noticeable. Centralistic conventional power generation is supplemented by distributed renewable energy resources. It is obvious that Germany will only meet the ambitious greenhouse gas-reduction targets - with phasing out nuclear energy at the same time - by a major increase in renewable energy usage. The pooling of large on- and offshore wind farms into clusters in the GW range will make new options feasible for an optimized integration of wind power. For this purpose, a new structure, the wind farm cluster will be introduced. All wind farms, which are directly or indirectly connected to one transmission network node, will be associated to one wind farm cluster. Major arguments against a massive penetration of RES are the intermittent generation, the poor predictability and the missing controllability. These arguments are disproved by adapting a virtual power plant (VPP) the Renewable Combi-Plant (RCP) which aggregates and controls large wind farms, PV plants, biogas fired CHP and pumped-storage hydro power plants making use of powerful RES prediction tools.

The protocols disjoint limits effectiveness of attacks from consumer TCP/IP devices. As DNP3 does not provide sufficient security for collaborative operations, security enhancements to DNP3 are proposed using data object security and a security layer.

We view such systems as the intertwined physical-cyber network interconnections of many non-uniform components, such as diverse energy sources and different classes of energy users, equipped with their own local cyber. This modeling approach is qualitatively different from the currently used models that do not explicitly account for the effects of sensing and communications. The proposed approach is based, instead, on representing all physical components as modules interconnected by means of an electric network. However, not all physical components can be modeled from first principles because of the extreme non-uniformity and the complexity of various classes of components. Instead, many components and/or groups of components have to be monitored and their models have to be identified using extensive signal processing, sensing, and model identification. We illustrate such combined cyber-physical models of key components, and use these to introduce a structure preserving model of a cyber-physical infrastructure of the interconnected system. Such a model becomes a basis for deciding what to sense and at which rate, what level of data mining is needed for which (groups of) physical modules to achieve predictable performance for cyber-physical future energy systems. This model rests on the premise that the performance of future energy systems can be shaped in major ways by means of broadly available cyber technologies.

Nowadays about 50 GW of wind power is installed in the UCTE power system. This causes difficulties especially in the optimal operation of the system and can lead to black outs due to problems with energy flow which is often not produced according to demand. An example occurred on November 4, 2006 when the UCTE system was divided into three parts with different frequencies. The reason for this was the uncontrolled share of power on the transit line caused by high, unpredicted wind penetration.

By analyzing the communication needs of the WAPS, the authors divide messages need to be transmitted into several sorts, and determine the demands of various messages for communication system. Based on that, the optical fiber is selected as the communication medium, and the broadband integrated service digital network based on SDH/SONET and ATM is selected as the network type. A network topology of mixed ring-star is designed. The network makes full use of the IEC 61850 based LAN in substation and power plant.
