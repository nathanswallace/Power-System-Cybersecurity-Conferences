S. Andrade; C. L. T. Borges; D. M. Falcao,"Fed. Univ. of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",2006 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting,20061016,2006,,,6 pp.,,This paper presents a discussion about modeling reliability aspects of distributed generation connected to distribution systems. Three different models developed by the authors are presented. The first is based on analytical method and is applicable to DG units of non-intermittent energy sources. The second considers the uncertainty of generation associated with wind generation and proposes a model based on multiple states Markov process. The third combines some aspects of the two previous models and aggregates the load variation curve in a sequential Monte Carlo simulation method. Practical operational premises are explored in all models,1932-5517;19325517,POD:1-4244-0493-2,10.1109/PES.2006.1708991,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1708991,Distributed Generation;Distribution Systems;Reliability;Uncertainty Modeling,Costs;Distributed control;Investments;Power generation;Power system modeling;Power system reliability;Solar power generation;Uncertainty;Wind energy;Wind energy generation,Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;distributed power generation;power distribution reliability;wind power plants,distributed generation;distribution systems;load variation curve;multiple states Markov process;nonintermittent energy sources;reliability aspects;sequential Monte Carlo simulation;wind generation,,9,12,,,,0-0 0,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesReal time issues for dynamic security assessment,N.

The classical numerical methods can be used to achieve accurate results for the CCT (critical clearing time) estimation despite they are time-consuming and not quite appropriate for real time applications.

New communication facilities are required to provide a decentralized energy management and to ensure the provision of system services by D&RES. In a case study, it is analyzed how the existing infrastructure can be used to build a communication network with different physical communication channels. Further more, the application of communication standards is investigated and in the result the use of the data models and the services of the communication standard IEC 61850 (for substation communication) is recommended. It is shown that the advantageous application of this standard and its subsequent standards IEC 61400-25 for wind power plants and IEC 62350 for dispersed generation requires consistency of all described models.
