Replacing manual interventions with a sophisticated algorithm running in closed-loop allows the network to be more flexible, and prevent network operators from making mistakes. Such algorithm must fulfill very high expectations about reliability, security and performance. The approach described in this paper shows that, by enabling data exchange between different substations, and by exploiting substations unused resources, it is possible to obtain a self-healing of distribution network in closed loop in which risks of manual interventions are reduced to minimum.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2,10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345588,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345588,Self-healing;control centers;data exchange;distribution networks;network topology;substations,DNA;Reliability;Smart grids;Substations;Switches;Transport protocols,closed loop systems;fault tolerant computing;power distribution control;substations,closed loop systems;control centers;data exchange;manual operator interventions;power distribution networks;self-healing applications;substations,,2,,16,,,,22-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesThe information hierarchy for the future grid,P.

Garlapati; S. K. Shukla,"Department of ECE, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia 24060",2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,20121110,2012,,,1,7,"The post-mortem analysis of few blackouts in US and Europe concluded that the hidden failure induced tripping of distance relays is one of the primary causes of blackouts. In order to provide the distance relays with situational awareness and improve their robustness to hidden failures, a non-intrusive agent based relay supervised distance protection scheme is proposed in [1] and their results seemed promising. Each relay is associated with an agent who has the ability to sense and communicate. The communication between hierarchically distinguished master and slave agents aid relays to differentiate a fault as a true fault or a hidden failure induced fault and respectively to trip or not to trip. The methodology presented in [1] is limited to single master agent and multiple slave agents communication therefore it can only be applied to smaller power system networks. In order to adapt the relay supervision scheme to a geographically widely distributed larger bus system, more than one master agent is required because the use of a single master agent may result in slave agent to master agent round trip communication delays greater than the relay fault clearing times which defeats the purpose of the relay supervision scheme. Therefore for a larger power grid that needs multiple master agents, finding the number of master agents required and the location of the master agents is an issue that has to be addressed. In this paper we modelled the problem of minimizing the number of master agents required to serve the slave agent queries and finding an optimum location for the master agents as a multiple facility location problem.

Giani; R. Bent; M. Hinrichs; M. McQueen; K. Poolla,"CNLS, Los Alamos National Laboratory",2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,20121110,2012,,,1,8,"There is an emerging consensus that the nation's electricity grid is vulnerable to cyber attacks. This vulnerability arises from the increasing reliance on using remote measurements, transmitting them over legacy data networks to system operators who make critical decisions based on available data. Data integrity attacks are a class of cyber attacks that involve a compromise of information that is processed by the grid operator. This information can include meter readings of injected power at remote generators, power flows on transmission lines, and relay states. These data integrity attacks have consequences only when the system operator responds to compromised data by re-dispatching generation under normal or contingency protocols. These consequences include (a) financial losses from sub-optimal economic dispatch to service loads, (b) robustness/resiliency losses from placing the grid at operating points that are at greater risk from contingencies, and (c) systemic losses resulting from cascading failures induced by poor operational choices. This paper is focussed on understanding the connections between grid operational procedures and cyber attacks. We first offer an example to illustrate how data integrity attacks can cause economic and physical damage by misleading operators into taking inappropriate decisions. We then focus on unobservable data integrity attacks involving power meter data. These are coordinated attacks where the compromised data is consistent with the physics of power flow, and is therefore passed by any bad data detection algorithm. We develop metrics to assess the economic impact of these attacks under operator re-dispatch decisions using optimal power flow methods. These metrics can be used to prioritize the adoption of appropriate countermeasures including PMU placement, encryption, hardware upgrades, and advanced detection algorithms.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2,10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345468,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345468,,Detection algorithms;Economics;Generators;Load flow;Phasor measurement units;Reliability,data integrity;failure analysis;load flow;phasor measurement;power system reliability;power system security;smart power grids,PMU placement;advanced detection algorithms;cascading failures;contingency protocols;coordinated attacks;cyber attacks;data detection algorithm;encryption;grid operational procedures;legacy data networks;nation electricity grid;optimal power flow methods;phasor measurement unit;power meter data;redispatching generation;relay states;remote generators;remote measurements;robustness-resiliency losses;smart grid data integrity attack assessment;suboptimal economic dispatch;systemic losses;transmission lines,,6,,24,,,,22-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesCyber attacks on power system state estimation through topology errors,A.

M. Amin,University of Minnesota,2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,20121110,2012,,,1,2,"Any complex dynamic infrastructure network typically has many layers, decision-making units and is vulnerable to various types of disturbances. Cyber connectivity has increased the complexity of the control systems and facilities it is intended to safely and reliably control. Thus, in order to defend electric infrastructure against the impacts of cyber-physical attacks, significant challenges must be overcome before extensive deployment and implementation of smart grid technologies can begin. Cyber security and interoperability are two of the key challenges of the smart grid transformation. As for security, it must be built-in as part of its design and NOT glued on as afterthought. Regarding recent cyber threat reports, it is fundamental to separate hype from the truth. What is most concerning about such reports is mainly one piece from an early article: The response to the alert was mixed. An audit of 30 utility companies that received the alert showed that only seven were in full compliance, although all of the audited companies had taken some precautions. This is the reality that needs to be addressed. A key challenge is to enable secure and very high-confidence sensing, communications, and control of a heterogeneous, widely dispersed, yet globally interconnected system. It is even more complex and difficult to control it for optimal efficiency and maximum benefit to the ultimate consumers while still allowing all its business components to compete fairly and freely. In the electric power industry and other critical infrastructures, new ways are being sought to improve network efficiency by eliminating congestion problems without seriously diminishing reliability and security. Effective, intelligent, hierarchically distributed control is required within a layered defense architecture that would enable parts of the networks to remain operational and even automatically reconfigure in the event of local failures or threats of failure. Sensing, communication and con- rol systems are needed across broad temporal, geographical, and industry scalesfrom devices to power-system-wide, from fuel sources to consumers, from utility pricing to demand response, and so on. With increased deployment of feedback and communication, opportunities arise for reducing consumption, for better exploiting renewable sources, and for increasing the reliability and performance of the transmission and distribution networks. At the same time, however, closing loops where they have never been closed before, across multiple temporal and spatial scales, creates control challenges as well. Societal and governmental visions for the smart grid will require the engagement of the controls community for their realization. Feedback, optimization, estimation, dynamics, stability... these and other control system concepts are core to smart grid technology. In many ways, the smart grid is a control problem! Another major strategic goal is to enable real-time demand management and responseto make is possible for customers to modify consumption in reaction to hourly changes in electricity prices and availability. We see inexpensive but advanced two-way secure wireless communications as essential: Dynamic modeling of energy flows, their optimization and control depend on the availability of trustworthy data streams from sensors and monitors distributed throughout the electricity delivery system, for example on power lines and local distribution transformers. Drawing on those inputs and the even more ubiquitous data transmitted securely and wirelessly from substations, operations engineers will be able to spot potential problems and make adjustments before problems arise. As these systems are put in place, they will provide the opportunity to investigate the whole range of issues that arise in connection with the smart grid, from hybrid vehicle integration and electricity market design to system automation and security.

Wang; J. Wan; S. Gupta,"ALSTOM Grid, Redmond, WA 98052, USA",2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,20121110,2012,,,1,1,"Summary form only given. As a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), Southwest Power Pool (SPP) is mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to ensure reliable supplies of power, adequate transmission infrastructure, and competitive wholesale prices of electricity. In order to further improve system reliability and competitive wholesale electricity prices, SPP is moving from its current Energy Imbalance Service (EIS) Market with multiple Balancing Authorities (BA's) to a consolidated BA and an Integrated Marketplace, which includes Energy and Operating Reserve Markets and Transmission Congestion Rights Markets. This paper discusses how system reliability is considered in Day-ahead (DA) to Real-time (RT) business processes of SPP Integrated Marketplace, from both market design and market management system implementation perspectives. These business processes include: (1) Day-Before-Day-Ahead (DBDA) Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) (2) Reserve Requirements Calculation (3) DA Market (4) DA RUC (5) Intra-Day RUC (6) Real-Time Balancing Market The ultimate goal of SPP Integrated Marketplace is to find the most economic solution to ensure system reliability, which is modeled as resource capacity adequacy and transmission security constraints in market clearing. Similar to other LMP based wholesale electricity markets, SPP adopts Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) and Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) in its new market design, which take into account N-1 grid contingency constraints in linear form for congestion management. In MMS design, Simultaneous Feasibility Test (SFT) is performed to capture transmission security constraints in DA market processes, while Real-time Contingency Analysis (RTCA) of Energy Management System provides real-time security constraints for RTBM clearing and pricing. Market power mitigation is conducted for each market clearing process to prevent from market participants abusing market power when comm- tted or dispatched out-of-merit due to reliability reasons. Resource offer cap decision is made via market behavior test, market structure test, and market impact test that are conducted in DA market, RUC and RTBM. One unique process designed for reliability in the Integrated Marketplace is the Reserve Zone Requirement Calculation. SPP establishes Reserve Zones to ensure the deliverability of cleared Operating Reserve throughout the SPP Balancing Authority Area (BAA). SPP calculates the amount of Operating Reserve required for the Operating Day, on both a system-wide basis and a Reserve Zone basis, to comply with the reliability requirements specified in the SPP Criteria. SPP calculates the hourly Regulation-Up, Regulation-Down and Contingency Reserve requirements on an SPP BAA basis and calculates minimum Operating Reserve requirements and maximum Operating Reserve limitations for each Reserve Zone. Reserve Zone Min and Max are calculated by simulating the outage of the largest generators in each zone and dispatch reserves according to historical reserve deployment patterns. Another feature in the Integrated Marketplace that helps operators to ensure reliable grid operation is the Pre-RTBM process. Pre-RTBM is a multi-interval Look-Ahead (LA) SCED that can provide operators with the recommendations for Out-of-Merit Energy (OOME) to pre-ramp or pre-position resources for future system events, such as load pick-up, wind or interchange fluctuation, etc, in order to avoid potential capacity shortage and reduce the startup of expensive fast-start generators. In summary, SPP Integrated Marketplace design and implementation take system reliability as the first priority. It brings economic benefit to market participants and reduces the â€œup-liftâ€ù payment caused by reliability assurance.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2,10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345215,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345215,Competitive Electricity Markets;Power System Reliability;Southwest Power Pool,Electricity;Power markets;Power system reliability;Real-time systems;Reliability;Security,energy management systems;power generation dispatch;power generation scheduling;power grids;power markets;power system security;power transmission economics;power transmission reliability,BAA;DA business process;DA market;DBDA-RUC;EIS market;FERC;Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;LMP based wholesale electricity markets;MMS design;N-1 grid contingency constraints;OOME;RT business process;RTBM clearing;RTBM pricing;RTCA;RTO;Regional Transmission Organization;SCUC;SFT;SPP balancing authority area;SPP integrated marketplace design;Southwest power pool integrated marketplace;balancing authority;competitive wholesale prices;congestion management;day-ahead business process;day-before-day-ahead reliability unit commitment;energy imbalance service market;energy management system;energy-operating reserve markets;expensive fast-start generators;intraday RUC real-time balancing market;market behavior test;market clearing process;market design;market impact test;market management system;market power mitigation;market structure test;multiinterval look-ahead SCED;out-of-merit energy;real-time business process;real-time contingency analysis;reserve zone basis;reserve zone min-max;reserve zone requirement calculation;security constrained economic dispatch;security constrained unit commitment;simultaneous feasibility test;system reliability;transmission congestion rights markets;transmission infrastructure;transmission security constraints,,3,,1,,,,22-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesObservability analysis and restoration for state estimation using SCADA and PMU data,G.

Hong; A. Stefanov; C. C. Liu; M. Govindarasu,Washington State University,2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,20121110,2012,,,1,1,"New technologies including microprocessor-based Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and standardized protocol and TCP/IP over wide area networks (WAN) are well-adopted in the substations. Remote access to IEDs or user interfaces in a substation for maintenance purposes is a common practice. However, there are potential cyber-physical system vulnerabilities in a substation, e.g., unsecured standard protocols, remote controllable IEDs, and unauthorized remote access to substation IEDs. In addition, some substation IEDs and user interfaces have a web server and hence it may provide a remote configuration change and control with default passwords. Even if firewalls and cryptography schemes are used for cyber security, weak security key management cryptography and mis-configured firewalls are still exposed to intruders. From IT point of view, cyber security issues are well known and new security technologies are available. However, security research on the integration of IT and physical power systems for critical infrastructures is still an emerging area. Intruders behaviors will generate logs across all substation-level networks, e.g., IEDs, firewalls and user interfaces. For instance, the steps of Stuxnet attack are based on: (1) intrusion attempts, (2) change of the file system, (3) change of target systems setting, and (4) change of target systems status. Therefore, anomaly detection is performed based on logs of intruders foot prints. Temporal anomaly can be determined from discrepancies between event logs from two different time periods. In the proposed anomaly index, a value of 0 implies no difference, whereas 1 indicates the maximal discrepancy [1]. In order to identify the impact of substation cyber intrusion to the power grid, cyber intrusion scenarios have been conducted on the substation IT network using a SCADA testbed at University College Dublin (UCD). The first intrusion scenario involves compromised substation gateway. A false signal is generated and - n open circuit breaker (CB) command is sent to substation CBs. The second scenario is to generate forged CB status at the gateway. As a result of this attack, control center operators will observe fake data about the CB status. However, the actual substation CBs status has not changed. The third scenario is to generate fabricated analogue values to a control center using a man-in-the-middle attack. Once an intruder successfully compromises the substation LAN, (s)he is able to monitor and capture all measured data which comes from power grids. If attackers send fabricated data to the control center and the data travel through the state estimation filter, control center operators will observe an operational emergency. As a result, the operators may take emergency control actions such as reducing the generation voltage or reactive power while the power system is actually in a normal condition. There is a possibility these (logical) actions based on fabricated data will drive the system into a sequence of cascading events, leading to a power outage. Mitigation actions are conducted on substation IT and power grid. For IT mitigation, intrusion detection system (IDS) which uses anomaly detection algorithm based on temporal event construction has been used in a substation network. An Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm with an objective function that minimizes load shedding in the grid is used for power system mitigation. The proposed collaboration scheme between IDS and the firewall is able to disconnect intruders in the substation network. Emergency control actions are taken to mitigate the effects of cyber intrusions as an attempt to restore a system back to a normal condition.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2,10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345766,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345766,,Circuit breakers;Computer security;Educational institutions;Substations;User interfaces,Internet;SCADA systems;cryptography;firewalls;load shedding;microprocessor chips;power grids;power system security;substations;transport protocols;user interfaces;wide area networks,IT mitigation;SCADA;Stuxnet attack;TCP/IP;Web server;anomaly detection;control center operators;cyberphysical security;emergency control;firewalls;intruders foot prints;intrusion attempts;intrusion detection system;key management cryptography;load shedding;man-in-the-middle attack;microprocessor based intelligent electronic devices;objective function;open circuit breaker command;optimal power flow algorithm;power grids;power system mitigation;remote access;remote configuration;standardized protocol;state estimation filter;substation cyber intrusion;substation gateway;user interfaces;wide area networks,,2,,1,,,,22-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesPrivacy and confidentiality in Cyber-Physical Power Systems,B.

Jia; Z. Xu,,2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,20121110,2012,,,1,5,"Along with the high pace of power network interconnection development in recent years, power system operational uncertainty is increasing rapidly and system dynamic behavior is becoming more and more complicated, which makes the risk assessment of cascading failures and catastrophic events in power systems more challenging. Therefore advanced methods of high reliability to assess risks of cascading failures under various power systems operation conditions need be developed. In this paper, a risk assessment framework for cascading failures based on the information entropy principle has been developed. The developed method aims at identifying the worst case cascading development among all other possibilities to support system operators in preparing countermeasures accordingly beforehand. A case study of cascading failure analysis for IEEE 30-bus system is carried out in details. N-1 contingencies are selected as the initiating events of cascading failures. The weighting factors of all types of severity (i.e. transmission line overload, bus voltage violation, real/reactive power violation of generators) are determined by entropy principle, as compared with conventional methods which use fixed values according to expertise information with different focus. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of this proposed approach are demonstrated through MATLAB.

The self-healing functions could enable a power grid to detect the event in advance and restore the system after contingencies with minimum damages. In this paper a control strategy to fast relieve overload in the self-healing smart grid is proposed. The basic principle of the control strategy is to redistribute power flow of a contingency transmission line to other lines by using unified power flow controller (UPFC). To implement the control strategy, distributed steady-state network and wide-area measurement (WAM) - based nodal analysis are proposed and applied to redistribute power flow. The proposed WAM-based nodal analysis is carried on to relieve overload quickly and effectively while realize the control objective accurately. Moreover, grid simplification based on controllable region analysis is applied to reduce computation burden. IEEE 39-bus test system based simulation is applied to verify the proposed control strategy. The results show that the control strategy can relieve overload quickly and effectively. Thus it could be an online controller for a self-healing smart grid to deal with harmful contingencies.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2,10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345042,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345042,Contingency;Emergency control;Overload;Self-healing;Smart grid;UPFC;WAMS,Generators;Load flow;Manganese;Reactive power;Smart grids;Steady-state;Voltage control,IEEE standards;fault tolerant computing;load flow control;power distribution control;power system measurement;power system restoration;power transmission control;power transmission lines;smart power grids,IEEE 39-bus test system;UPFC;WAM;contingency transmission line;controllable region analysis;distributed steady-state network;fast relieve overload control strategy;nodal analysis;power flow redistribution;self-healing smart power grid;system restoration;unified power flow controller;wide-area measurement,,0,,25,,,,22-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesEngineering resilient cyber-physical systems,T.

We present a cyber-physical flocking-based protocol to address the issue of system faults. We extend this work to derive a spectral matrix based generator coherency identification algorithm to analyze the coherency amongst synchronized generators after fault clearing. Generators with high coherency are grouped in an agent while those with low coherency form another. For each agent, the generator having highest inertia is selected as the lead component. In order to reduce the required communication and energy of the control protocol, cyber interaction between agents is realized by coupling only lead generators. By using our developed flocking-based protocol, all the lead generators achieve consensus to the desired nominal frequency and their phase angles achieve phase cohesiveness. Subsequently secondary generators within each agent are able track these stabilizing lead dynamics due to strong physical couplings.

Therefore, defensive techniques such as intrusion detection will need to be deployed and used in this already complicated system. Deployment and runtime cost due to the defensive systems will affect the normal function of smart grid system without careful planning and design. This paper is an effort to address this issue. In particular, we apply the set packing algorithm to optimize (minimize) the placement of the trust nodes of the defensive system in the multiple layer architecture of the smart grid. After the trust nodes are placed, a Dijkstra's based optimal routing algorithm is used to find the least cost routing between the communications of the nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach is promising in decreasing the overall cost while keeping the security of the smart grid system.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2,10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345688,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345688,cyber security;multiple-layer system;optimal location;optimal routing;smart grid;trust node,Algorithm design and analysis;Communication networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Smart grids;Wide area networks,optimisation;power engineering computing;power system economics;security of data;smart power grids;telecommunication network routing,Dijkstra-based optimal routing algorithm;communication routing optimization;defensive systems;least cost routing;location optimization;multiple layer architecture;nodes communications;normal function;set packing algorithm;smart grid network infrastructure;trust nodes,,1,,20,,,,22-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesPower sharing and control in distributed generation with wireless sensor networks,R. Majumder; G. Bag; K. H. Kim,ABB CORPORATE RESEARCH,2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,20121110,2012,,,1,1,"Summary form only given. This paper proposes application of wireless sensor networks in distributed generation. Furthermore in order to have a reliable communication with minimal end to end delay during the event of next hop node failure the paper proposes Find Reliable Link (FRL) scheme. Power sharing can be improved significantly in a conventional decentralized power control by correcting the distributed generators reference signals with wireless sensor networks as proposed in this paper. Even a low bandwidth communication among the distributed generators and control center can overcome the system operation challenges posed by network line parameters, failure of distributed generators and power shortage in the system. In order to ensure reliable communication between the sensor nodes or distributed generators and control center the paper proposes FRL scheme. The scheme aims to enable the system to make a quick recovery from sensor node failures or link failure due to obstacles thereby reducing the end to end delay. The proposed communication scheme is verified by implementing it in Qualnet 5.0. A detail data traffic analysis is presented to demonstrate how reliability is improved in the proposed communication method. Closed loop simulation of communication network with distributed power sources also validates the reliability of the proposed schemes.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2,10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344966,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344966,,Delay;Distributed power generation;Educational institutions;Generators;Power control;Reliability;Wireless sensor networks,closed loop systems;distributed power generation;power control;power generation reliability;wireless sensor networks,FRL scheme;Qualnet 5.0;closed loop simulation;control center;data traffic analysis;decentralized power control;distributed generator reference signals;distributed power sources;find reliable link scheme;link failure;low bandwidth communication;next hop node failure;power sharing;power shortage;reliable communication;sensor node failures;wireless sensor networks,,4,,,,,,22-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesApplying self-healing schemes to modern power distribution systems,J. R. AgÃ_ero,"Quanta Technology, 4020, Westchase Blvd. Suite 300, Raleigh, NC, 27607",2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,20121110,2012,,,1,4,"Self-healing schemes in the context of power distribution systems have the objective of performing fault location, isolation, and service restoration in an automated fashion, i.e., without (or with limited) distribution system operator and repair crew intervention. Some of the intrinsic benefits of this smart distribution technology are increased reliability due to outage duration reduction, more efficient use of personnel and resources (crews, operators, vehicles, etc), and increased operational flexibility. Reliability is naturally increased since less time is needed for locating and isolating faulted feeder areas, as well as for restoring customers located on healthy feeder sections. Self-healing schemes are an inherent part of the Smart Grid and are expected to play a fundamental role in modern and future distribution systems. It is worth noting that the switchgear technology (protective and switching devices, including adaptive protection), sensors, enterprise systems and communications infrastructures required for the implementation of self-healing schemes represent the basis for the execution of other smart distribution applications such as automated system reconfiguration and optimization. Therefore, a growing number of self-healing projects are being implemented by utilities as part of their power delivery modernization plans. This paper discusses the estimation of reliability benefits of self-healing schemes, with emphasis on Fault Location, Identification and Service Restoration (FLISR) applied to real distribution feeders.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2,10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344960,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344960,Smart Grid;distribution automation;distribution reliability;self-healing technologies;smart distribution systems,Automation;Circuit faults;Fault location;Power system reliability;Smart grids;Switches,fault location;power distribution faults;power distribution protection,adaptive protection;automated system reconfiguration;fault isolation;fault location;fault service restoration;faulted feeder;healthy feeder sections;modern power distribution systems;power delivery modernization plans;protective devices;repair crew intervention;self-healing schemes;service restoration;smart distribution applications;switching devices,,10,,15,,,,22-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesImpacts of control and communication system vulnerabilities on power systems under contingencies,M.

Hayat,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA",2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,20121110,2012,,,1,7,"Modern power grids rely heavily on their control systems operating over communication networks to mitigate the effects of stresses in the grid. However, the cascading phenomenon and blackouts remain possible if the initial disturbances in the power grid are accompanied by other system vulnerabilities such as failures of the communication and control systems that transmit and implement critical control signals. Understanding the effects of such vulnerabilities are important in the design of future smart grids. In this paper the vulnerabilities in the control and communication system are coupled with the load shedding mechanism and their effects on power-grid cascading behavior are revealed by means of simulation. In particular, the cascading failure behavior of the grid is investigated considering the effects of failures in the control and communication systems, as well as the topological location of the failures.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2,10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344866,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344866,Power system control;cascading failures;load shedding;power system communication;vulnerabilities,Communication systems;Control systems;Load modeling;Power grids;Power system faults;Power system protection,load shedding;power grids;power system control;power system faults,blackouts;cascading failure behavior;communication system vulnerabilities;control systems;critical control signals;failure topological location;load shedding mechanism;power grid cascading behavior;power systems;smart grids;stress effect mitigation,,7,,16,,,,22-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesReliability modeling of cyber-physical electric power systems: A system-theoretic framework,A.

These systems are undergoing a radical transformation in structure and functionality enabled by new technologies, e.g., advanced communication and control, renewable-based generation, and advanced power electronics. The added functionality comes with side effects of increased system complexity and the introduction of new sources of uncertainty in systems already inherently complex. Current reliability analysis tools are inadequate to capture the impacts of integrating this new technology. Without proper reliability analysis tools, poorly understood, unreliable and unsafe systems will result, leading to catastrophic consequences if deployed. Thus, it is key to create systematic analytical tools to capture the impacts of new technology integration on power system reliability. In this paper, the discussion focuses on tools for quantifying power system reliability when there is coupling between cyber and physical components, and there is coupling between system dynamics and component stress.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2,10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345518,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345518,,Couplings;Power system dynamics;Power system reliability;Power system stability;Reliability;Switches,power system planning;power system reliability,advanced power electronics;catastrophic consequence;component stress;cyber-physical electric power system;electric power system operation;electric power system planning;renewable-based generation;system dynamics coupling;system-theoretic framework;systematic reliability analysis tool,,4,,38,,,,22-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
