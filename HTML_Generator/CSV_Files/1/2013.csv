Belfast, Belfast, UK",2013 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting,20131125,2013,,,1,5,"Increased complexity and interconnectivity of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in Smart Grids potentially means greater susceptibility to malicious attackers. SCADA systems with legacy communication infrastructure have inherent cyber-security vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with little consideration of cyber threats. In order to improve cyber-security of SCADA networks, this paper presents a rule-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method, which includes signature-based and model-based approaches tailored for SCADA systems. The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known suspicious or malicious attacks. In addition, model-based detection is proposed as a complementary method to detect unknown attacks. Finally, proposed intrusion detection approaches for SCADA networks are implemented and verified via Snort rules.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4799-1303-9; POD:978-1-4799-1302-2; USB:978-1-4799-1301-5,10.1109/PESMG.2013.6672100,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6672100,Cyber-security;IEC 60870-5-104;Intrusion detection system;SCADA,IEC standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;SCADA systems;Servers,SCADA systems;power system security;protocols;safety systems;smart power grids,DPI method;IDS;IEC 60870-5-104;SCADA systems;Snort rules;cyber security vulnerabilities;cyber threats;deep packet inspection method;legacy communication infrastructure;malicious attackers;model-based detection;rule-based intrusion detection system;signature-based approaches;smart grids;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;unknown attacks,,11,14,,,,21-25 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesSolar Commercial Virtual Power Plant,B.

One of the driving forces was the often generous governmental support. In Belgium (Flanders) for example, investors could acquire green power certificates worth ���450/MWh during several years. However, due to the large boom of solar plants and hence rising subsidy cost, governments are dropping this support (eg. ���450/MWh in 2009 to ���90/MWh in 2012 for Flanders). In this paper the authors investigate if solar energy can become more profitable if forces are joined in a Commercial Virtual Power Plant to sell the solar power on the wholesale market. The numbers are based on the Flemish region, however, the same procedure can be applied to other markets as well. It turned out that for existing installations the potential benefits are marginal due to the small share of the energy revenue compared to the subsidy revenue in the total income of a solar plant. However, lower subsidies and coupling with other production resources and (flexible) consumers promise to be more profitable, although this needs more investigation.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4799-1303-9; POD:978-1-4799-1302-2; USB:978-1-4799-1301-5,10.1109/PESMG.2013.6672305,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6672305,,Contracts;Couplings;Government;Green products;Renewable energy sources;Stock markets,power generation economics;power markets;solar power stations,Belgium;energy revenue;governmental support;green power certificates;photovoltaic energy;solar commercial virtual power plant;solar plants;subsidy cost;subsidy revenue;wholesale market,,3,15,,,,21-25 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesMulti-agent testbed for emerging power systems,M.

In addition, the software allows for definitions to be made of the hierarchical relationship between devices in the physical world and for these relationships to be dynamically altered.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4799-1303-9; POD:978-1-4799-1302-2; USB:978-1-4799-1301-5,10.1109/PESMG.2013.6672625,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6672625,Demand Response;Energy Information Gateway;Energy Management System;Smart Grid,Buildings;Data structures;Load management;Logic gates;Plugs;Software;Strips,demand side management;energy management systems;power engineering computing;software architecture,commercial environments;demand-side energy management;energy management;home-office automation;modular software architecture;next generation energy information gateway;open source reference design;residential environments;software architecture;supervisory control,,3,11,,,,21-25 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesPrevention of NERC C3 category outages in Idaho power's network: Risk based methodology and practical application,M.

Ciniglio,"Idaho Power, Boise, ID, USA",2013 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting,20131125,2013,,,1,5,"This paper addresses the development of a risk-based contingency analysis for planning and operating a transmission system. The primary focus of the paper is on assessing power system performance following the consecutive loss of two bulk transmission elements (n-1-1 contingency analysis). The developed approach can be extended to perform the risk-based analysis of other types of contingencies (n-1, n-2, and n-k) used in planning and operation; this approach can use various types of system adjustments as mitigation measures depending on the types and values of post-contingency limit violations. In this paper, we assume generation rescheduling and/or load curtailment are available for mitigation, and these adjustments are given the highest priority. The suggested approach is a further enhancement of the present deterministic approach used by Idaho Power in performing North Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) compliance studies. Contingency probability, an essential element for risk calculation, was estimated from historical outage data captured and archived by the Idaho Power Generation and Transmission Outage Reporting System (GATOR).",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4799-1303-9; POD:978-1-4799-1302-2; USB:978-1-4799-1301-5,10.1109/PESMG.2013.6672893,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6672893,���n-1-1�۪ Contingency Analysis;Consequence;NERC Planning Standards;Optimal Mitigation Measures;Probability;Risk;Security,Indexes;Planning;Power system reliability;Power system stability;Reliability;Security,power transmission planning;risk analysis;scheduling,GATOR;Idaho power generation;Idaho power network;NERC C3 category outages prevention;NERC compliance;North Electric Reliability Corporation;bulk transmission elements;consecutive loss;generation rescheduling;historical outage data;load curtailment;n-1-1 contingency analysis;planning;power system performance;risk based methodology;risk calculation;risk-based contingency analysis;transmission outage reporting system;transmission system,,3,30,,,,21-25 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesAn adaptive method for detection and correction of errors in PMU measurements,Di Shi; D.

America, Cupertino, CA, USA",2013 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting,20131125,2013,,,1,1,"PMU data are expected to be GPS-synchronized measurements with highly accurate magnitude and phase angle information. However, this potential accuracy is not always achieved in actual field installations due to various causes. It has been observed in some PMU measurements that the voltage and current phasors are corrupted by noise and bias errors. This paper presents a novel method for detection and correction of errors in PMU measurements with the concept of calibration factors. The proposed method uses nonlinear optimal estimation theory to calculate calibration factor using a traditional model of an untransposed transmission line with unbalanced load. This method is intended to work as a pre-filtering scheme that can significantly improve the accuracy of the PMU measurement for further use in system state estimation, transient stability monitoring, wide area protection, etc. Case studies based on simulated data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4799-1303-9; POD:978-1-4799-1302-2; USB:978-1-4799-1301-5,10.1109/PESMG.2013.6672355,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6672355,,Accuracy;Current measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Phase measurement;Phasor measurement units;Transmission line measurements;Voltage measurement,calibration;error correction;error detection;nonlinear estimation;phasor measurement,GPS-synchronized measurement;PMU measurement;adaptive method;calibration factor;current phasor;error correction;error detection;nonlinear optimal estimation theory;prefiltering scheme;voltage phasor,,2,,,,,21-25 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesImpact of cyber attacks on transient stability of smart grids with voltage support devices,B.

This is possible if based on network self-healing capability, the neighbour microgrids are interconnected and a surplus generation capacity is available in some of the Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) of the interconnected microgrids. This will reduce or prevent load shedding within the microgrids with less generation capacity. Therefore, DERs in a microgrid are controlled such that they share the local load within that microgrid as well as the loads in other interconnected microgrids. Different control algorithms are proposed to manage the DERs at different operating conditions. On the other hand, a Distribution Static Compensator (DSTATCOM) is employed to regulate the voltage. The efficacy of the proposed power control, sharing and management among DERs in multiple interconnected microgrids is validated through extensive simulation studies using PSCAD/EMTDC.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4799-1303-9; POD:978-1-4799-1302-2; USB:978-1-4799-1301-5,10.1109/PESMG.2013.6672794,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6672794,DSTATCOM;Interconnected Microgrids;Power Sharing;Self-Healing Network,Circuit breakers;Circuit faults;Density estimation robust algorithm;Microgrids;Reactive power;Smart grids;Voltage control,distributed power generation;load shedding;power control;power distribution control;power system interconnection;smart power grids;static VAr compensators,DER;DSTATCOM;EMTDC;PSCAD;autonomous mode;control algorithms;distributed energy resources;distribution static compensator;load shedding;local load sharing;multiple interconnected microgrids;power control;self-healing medium voltage network;surplus generation capacity,,8,17,,,,21-25 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesMulti-Agent based Smart Grid management and simulation: Situation awareness and learning in a test bed with simulated and real installations and players,H.

A forced outage rate (FOR) model is proposed considering the impacts of cyber attacks on the reliability characteristic of generators and transmission lines. Different occurrences of the cyber attacks targeting the system lead to different effects on the FOR values.
