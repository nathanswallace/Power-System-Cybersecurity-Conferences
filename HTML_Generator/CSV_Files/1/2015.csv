A lot of distributed optimization algorithms have been adopted to optimize these PV-ES combined system. Units in the system exchange information through communication network to maximize the net profit synergistically. A lot of research works have been carried out but mainly focused on enhancing the efficiency of optimization algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to give some guidance on how to design a better communication network by innovatively analyzing the performance of a typical distributed optimization algorithm on different network topology. Several classic topologies of communication network are introduced respectively. Furthermore, a series of simulation are investigated. The performances are analyzed based on graph theory. The implication of Laplacian eigenvalues and degree distribution are discussed.

Garcia; A. Giani; R. Baldick,"Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, United States",2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting,20151005,2015,,,1,5,"Unobservable data integrity attacks are coordinated cyber attacks on power meter readings that are undetectable by any bad data detection algorithm. Counter measures against data integrity attacks have been extensively studied in the context of observable islands; however, the concept of observable islands has only been introduced for a specific type of attack known as the power injection attack which compromises only power injection meters and power flow meters. This manuscript introduces the concept of observable islands to a recently identified type of data integrity attack that may also compromise breaker status meters. We call this type of attack a General Data Integrity attack (GDI attack). The results presented here allow for observable island based PMU placement countermeasures, initially developed for power injection attacks, to be applied to GDI attacks.

Electronic and Electrical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, China",2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting,20151005,2015,,,1,5,"Cyber security is one critical issue for Internet protocol (IP)-based cyber-physical systems. To protect physical systems from possible malicious intrusions, cyber infrastructures, e.g., firewalls, are installed in systems. However, with more intelligent cyberattacks, existing firewalls may not be advanced enough to protect these intelligent cyberattacks, which increase the probability of outages and reduce system reliability levels. In this case, cyber infrastructures should be updated to deal with more intelligent cyberattacks. This paper proposes a probabilistic method for making decisions about updating strategies of cyber infrastructures. Considering stochastic characteristics of cyberattacks, a reliability-based cost-effective updating model for cyber infrastructures is formulated. The optimal updating strategy balances the system reliability and the cost caused by updating cyber infrastructures. The proposed method is illustrated on the IEEE 30-bus system, and the results show the feasibility for informing updating cyber infrastructures.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-8040-9; POD:978-1-4673-8041-6,10.1109/PESGM.2015.7286403,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7286403,Cost effective;cyber infrastructure;cyber security;probabilistic;updating strategy,Computer crime;Firewalls (computing);Intrusion detection;Load modeling;Optimization;Reliability,Internet;carrier transmission on power lines;probability;protocols;stochastic processes,IEEE 30-bus system;Internet protocol-based cyber-physical systems;cyber infrastructures;cyber security;intelligent cyberattacks;malicious intrusions;outage probability;probabilistic method;reliability-based updating strategies;stochastic characteristics;system reliability levels,,,13,,,,26-30 July 2015,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesDealing with a complex smart grid: An integrated perspective,S.

Consumers' load changes with periodic pattern of production and life, meanwhile, it is also affected by some random factors. To reveal the relevance between CBL and the influence brought by the periodic trend and random factors of the load, an analysis is done in the paper. Firstly, discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is used to decompose the historical load into different periodic components. Then error of CBL calculation methods is analyzed.

This ability is known as Self-Healing, a concept most widespread in distribution power systems. In transmission power systems, however, there is a substantially lower amount of research. Some authors says the actual transmission is inherently self-healing since its topology is meshed designed, which ensures redundancy for equipment trips, preventing a load outage. Nevertheless, automatic transmission systems reconfiguration presents high improvement potential in the restoring process, in terms of security and agility. Under this scenario, this paper sets the framework for a self-healing system to perform in the transmission system. In this framework, are considered the main technical requirements, concerns, points of attention and inherent issues of transmission operation process. The Assisted-Healing concept will also be considered for such circumstances in which the Self-Healing is not convenient or not possible to be fully performed.

Before the IEDs are installed in the substation, functions are tested by the manufactures to ensure that the functions operate properly as designed. A conventional function test platform is made of amplifiers with copper wire connection to the IEDs. It has drawbacks such as high cost, limited flexibility, and limited number of signal channels. With the introduction of the IEC61850 standard, IEDs are able to obtain measurement from merging units (MU) via the process bus. Consequently, using MUs to replace the amplifier for IED function testing has been studied by several research groups. All of them use hardware MUs or power system simulator embedded MUs. These MUs based test platforms have weakness such as limitation of the number of MUs and lower flexibility in MU performance modification, This paper proposes a novel IED functional test platform using software MU (sMU), which mitigates the above limitations. Thanks to the software approach, different MU performance scenarios can be easily configured instead of using a complicated communications simulator. The sMU based test platform concept has been proved by performing accuracy and operate-time tests with transformer differential protection. Comparing with conventional test platform, sMU based test platform has better results in the accuracy tests and similar performance in the operate-time tests. Therefore, it is feasible to use sMU based platform for IED functional tests.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4673-8040-9; POD:978-1-4673-8041-6,10.1109/PESGM.2015.7285783,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7285783,IEC61850;IED functional test;Substation Automation Systems;process bus;software Merging Unit,Accuracy;IEC Standards;Merging;Power systems;Software;Testing,configuration management;electron device testing;power system simulation;software maintenance;substation automation;transformer protection,IEC61850 standard;IED functional test platform;amplifier;copper wire connection;hardware MU;intelligent electronic device;power system simulator embedded MU;sMU;signal channel;software merging unit;substation automation system;transformer differential protection,,1,12,,,,26-30 July 2015,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesPower sharing in microgrids with minimum communication control,S.

Due to this functional nature, SPSs are extremely vulnerable when cyber-attacks take place and significant impacts and losses might follow. Under such circumstances, risk assessment for SPS has become critical. A novel cyber-physical SPS risk assessment method is proposed in this paper which takes into account both the possible cyber-attacks and SPS physical responses. Cyber-physical SPS system is modeled based on Deterministic and Stochastic Petri-Net (DSPN), and the risk is measured as the expected value of social welfare decrease. IEEE 9-bus model equipped with generation rejection protection scheme is selected as a study case to demonstrate the risk assessment method.
