The IMS allows its users to analyze the data collected by multiple control and communication networks to characterize the states of the smart grid. Abnormal, corrupted, or erroneous measurement data and outliers are detected and analyzed to identify whether they are caused by random equipment failures, human error, or tampering. Data collected from different information networks are crosschecked for data integrity based on redundancy, dependency, correlation, or cross-correlations, which reveal the interdependency between data sets. A hierarchically structured reasoning mechanism is used to rank possible causes of an event to enable system operators to proactively respond or provide mitigation recommendations to remove or neutralize the threats. The model satisfactorily identifies the cause of an event and significantly reduces the need to process myriads of data.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4577-1002-5; Online:978-1-4577-1001-8; Paper:978-1-4577-1000-1,10.1109/PES.2011.6039214,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6039214,cyber security;data integrity;interoperability;predictive defense;reliability;smart grid,Cognition;Communication networks;Data models;Pattern recognition;Reliability;Smart grids,information management;power system management;power system reliability;power system simulation;smart power grids,communication networks;data integrity;hierarchical information management system;hierarchically structured reasoning mechanism;multiple control;smart grid,,4,15,,,,24-29 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesWireless AMI application and security for controlled home area networks,V.

Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), commonly known as the smart meter, which has the capability of supporting various functions beyond that of recording energy usage, will facilitate this expected increase in consumer participation. Another primary benefit of AMI is load and cost management for the utility. AMI requires a reliable communication system between the smart meter and consumer equipment. This paper identifies wireless networking solutions such as ZigBee as the best mode for such communication. Due to the shared nature of the wireless medium, however, these deployments face security challenges and interference issues. These must be addressed, taking into account the interests of both the utility and the consumer. This paper takes a comprehensive look at wireless security in the AMI based home-area network by identifying a wide range of possible vulnerabilities.

Protection security assessment can be investigated under two different aspects: on the one hand the behavior regarding selectivity, speed and sensitivity and on the other hand the behavior regarding the response on dynamic network phenomena as voltage stability and transient stability. This paper is focused on the protection response on dynamic network phenomena and presents innovative strategies for this investigation aspect.

While these advances promise better capabilities, for example, an electric grid with increased reliability and efficiency, they also increase the risk to the control systems from cyber attacks. A significant effort is underway by government, industry, national labs and academia to develop and deploy security technologies that assess and mitigate this increased risk. This effort includes select programs funded by the US Departments of Energy<sup>1</sup> and Homeland Security<sup>2</sup>, the US Reinvestment and Recovery Act, the National Institute of Standards and Technologies led Smart Grid Interoperability Panel<sup>3</sup>, and standard development bodies to name a few. The focus of this effort includes electric grid systems ranging from smart meters and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems to synchrophasor based Wide Area Measurement Systems<sup>4</sup>, oil and gas SCADA systems, and industrial control systems. A timely challenge in this environment, therefore, is to explore the right cyber security constructs and principles that can guide the effort and ultimately result in secure critical infrastructure for the nation. It is our contention that commonly employed defense-in-depth constructs centered on building layers of defense are insufficient to achieve that objective. Instead, there is a need to explore strategic resilience-based approaches that involve designing the systems to protect critical components and functions, strive to provide service in the face of cyber attacks, and ensure timely response and recovery if the attacks succeed.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4577-1002-5; Online:978-1-4577-1001-8; Paper:978-1-4577-1000-1,10.1109/PES.2011.6039873,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6039873,,Buildings;Computer security;Context modeling;Resilience;SCADA systems,SCADA systems;power grids;power meters;power system measurement,SCADA;critical control systems;defense-in-depth;power grid;smart meters;strategic resilience;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;wide area measurement systems,,0,7,,,,24-29 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesPerformance of power electronic interfaced DERs integrated with communication network,R.

Due to many stochastic factors in a communication environment, communication latency will be best modeled as a random parameter with a probability density function. The latency of sending/receiving messages among distributed intelligent agents is randomly generated based on user input data.

The latter secures the operability of the system taking into account contingencies. The security is often measured by the N-1 criterion, i.e., the system can maintain balance and stability with the loss of any single element.

Stronger modeling effort can be applied to specific systems under test while the remainder of the environment can be filled in with less labor-intensive elements. The VCSE includes software that federates and automates together capabilities across simulation domains (here, the control system components, their networking, and the power grid). This document introduces the VCSE approach to hybrid simulation of the grid and control systems (compared with other approaches). In particular, the VCSE incorporates one key feature: simulation software and hardware are federated through networking interfaces (both real and virtual). This allows for straightforward system-in-the-loop (SITL) analysis, which is of paramount importance for cyber security analysis, as the failure modes of the system under test depend so strongly on its ensemble characteristics (hardware/software/configuration/application).

It is proposed that an effective interactive framework should be put in place for decision-making that enables choice and it also meets the social objectives. Given the complexity of the electric energy systems this process can no longer be based on blue print rules supported by coarse scenario analysis. It requires, instead, Information Technology (IT)-enabled dynamic and interactive modeling and decision making by all industry stakeholders. In addition, the process requires a design of regulatory rights, rules and responsibilities (3Rs) for binding interactions that must be communicated between different industry participants. Moreover, it is suggested that the coarse National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) can no longer support the design of 3Rs. Instead, an Energy Temporal and Spatial Kit (ENTASK) is proposed to interactively link with the NEMS model that is well understood by the policy makers at present. An ENTASK-like tool is essential for facilitating public policy decision makers in assessing potential of diverse technologies while designing the 3Rs for the industry. The 3Rs must be binding as they have major financial, technical and economic implications.

Castro,Imperial College London,2011 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,20111010,2011,,,1,4,"In principle, a electricity transmission network security standard that is established within a risk-based framework is superior over the deterministic approach, usually presented in the form of an N-k type rule, as it balances more accurately the reliability (and other) benefits against operation and investment costs incurred to deliver these benefits. However, in the absence of advance technology to monitor, predict, simulate and control large-scale networks in real time, deterministic standards have historically delivered a successful operation of massive and complex electric networks. However, nowadays through the usage of new technology such as Special Protection Schemes (SPS), coordinated voltage control technique, wide-area monitoring and control systems (WAMC), Dynamic Security Assessment techniques (DSA), grid friendly controllers for Demand Side Management (DSM) etc, there is a genuine possibility to apply a probabilistic framework for network security. A risk-based framework will not only maximise the value of transmission but also speed up the connections of wind power. Through qualitative analyses we point out various problems of the present deterministic standards in the UK together with identifying key benefits at a regulatory and operational level of implementing a probabilistic standard. In addition, through quantitative analyses we show that current deterministic standards significantly overvalue reliability risks and, in fact, a probabilistic cost-benefit framework can lead to important savings in the cost of constraints without significantly increasing the risk of system interruptions.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4577-1002-5; Online:978-1-4577-1001-8; Paper:978-1-4577-1000-1,10.1109/PES.2011.6039494,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6039494,Transmission operation;cost-benefit analysis;power system economics;transfer capability;transmission investment;transmission planning;wind generation,Electricity;Investments;Probabilistic logic;Reliability;Security;Standards;Wind,investment;power system security;power transmission economics;power transmission reliability;probability;risk management;wind power plants,N-k type rule;coordinated voltage control technique;demand side management;deterministic approach;dynamic security assessment techniques;electricity transmission network security standard;grid friendly controllers;investment costs;large-scale network control;overvalue reliability risks;probabilistic cost-benefit framework;probabilistic standard;risk-based network operation;special protection schemes;wide-area monitoring and control systems;wind power,,5,6,,,,24-29 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesVirtual power plants for isolated and jointly operating electric power supply systems� Perspectives and challenges for Russia,D.

On the methodological side a risk metric has been defined assigning a value to the cyber/power risk in relation to the occurrence rate of cyber contingencies and their impact on the power service. The higher criticality threats have been experimented in the RSE Laboratory by simulating selected attack processes on telecontrol test beds of passive interconnected HV/MV distribution grids. The experiments concern cyber threats to ICT network components, such as routers and SCADA systems, having a critical role in power grid operation. The experiments assessed the residual vulnerabilities of protected IEC 60870-5-104 TCP/IP based communications between Control Centres and Substation Automation Systems in presence of attack processes assuming different degrees of knowledge about the attacked system's behaviour. The evaluation framework supporting the experimental activity allows monitoring the communication status through a set of measurements such as Inter Message Time, Number of Lost Messages, Inter Reconnection Time and Time To Failure. The knowledge and measures from controlled experiments are then exploited by the cyber-risk metrics to improve the estimation of the vulnerability and threat probabilities related to the successfulness of a given attack.",1932-5517;19325517,Electronic:978-1-4577-1002-5; Online:978-1-4577-1001-8; Paper:978-1-4577-1000-1,10.1109/PES.2011.6039589,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6039589,Computer-based attacks;Cyber risk assessment;Information and communication security;Power emergency management;Power grid control;Resilience testing;SCADA systems;Substation Automation;Test beds,Malware;Power control;Power systems;Process control;SCADA systems,power system control;power system protection;substation protection,ICT network components;attack experiments;cyber risk assessment;cyber risks;cyber threats;inter reconnection time;number of lost messages;passive interconnected HV/MV distribution grids;power control systems;power grid control systems;power grid operation;substation automation systems;telecontrol test beds;time to failure,,9,33,,,,24-29 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesArtificial immune system based intrusion detection in a distributed hierarchical network architecture of smart grid,Y.

Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless technologies including 802.15.4, 802.11, and the Zigbee protocol. Each of these will expose the power grid to cyber security threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a Distributed Intrusion Detection System for Smart Grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the Analyzing Module (AM) in the multiple layers of smart grids. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid - the home area network (HAN), neighborhood area network (NAN), and the Wide Area Network (WAN) - where they will use Artificial Immune System (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyber attacks. AMs at each level will be trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection.

The focus of this paper is on data integrity attacks on messages exchanged between the control center and actuators in the voltage control loop. Devices such as the ones belonging to the FACTS family (STATCOM, SVC, TCR, etc.), are connected to the system at designated points for voltage control purposes. An attacker could cause a detrimental impact on the system by performing an attack on the control messages sent to these devices which would manipulate its settings. The aim of this paper is to highlight the impact of an attack targeted at such voltage control deices in the system. This paper presents a template that might be used by an attacker with knowledge of system functionality. The paper also explains the sensitivity analysis technique which will help the attacker identify the device to be compromised.

This is the second of two new papers, which extend this previous work to summarize the state of the art in cascading failure risk analysis methodologies and modeling tools. The first paper reviews the state of the art in methodologies for performing risk assessment of potential cascading outages. This paper describes the state of the art in cascading failure modeling tools, documenting the view of experts representing utilities, universities and consulting companies. The paper is intended to constitute a valid source of information and references about presently available tools that deal with prediction of cascading failure events. This effort involves reviewing published literature and other documentation from vendors, universities and research institutions. The assessment of cascading outages risk evaluation is in continuous evolution. Investigations to gain even better understanding and identification of cascading events are the subject of several research programs underway aimed at solving the complexity of these events that electrical utilities face today.
