The next generation of high performance systems is designed and upgraded with the interdisciplinary knowledge for achieving these abilities for optimum operations. To accomplish this goal NSF and ONR have developed an initiative to promote interdisciplinary research and education paradigm that draws from the advanced systems theory, economics and regulatory concepts, environmental and social sciences concepts and computational intelligence. The collaboration also promotes the new education pedagogy, which builds new power courses being taught by power engineers, economist and system theorists. Lastly, the research portfolio of NSF power program and some other initiative by NSF and ONR is discussed at the panel.",,POD:0-7803-7989-6,10.1109/PES.2003.1267142,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1267142,,Collaboration;Computational intelligence;Educational programs;Environmental economics;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering education;Power generation economics;Power system economics;Power system security;Systems engineering education,power engineering education;power markets;power system economics;power system security;risk management,NSF power program;economist;education pedagogy;electric power networks efficiency;electric power system security;high performance systems;interdisciplinary knowledge;interdisciplinary power program;military systems;power courses;power engineers;service disruption;system theorists,,0,,,,,13-17 July 2003,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesIntelligent network reconfiguration of shipboard power systems,K.

In this new era of the US navy with goals to reduce manning and increase system survivability, automatic reconfiguration of the electrical network in a shipboard power system is critical for quickly restoring service to a section of the power of the power system to survive battle damage. Also reconfiguration is critical to meet operational requirements such as changing from one mission to another, avoiding possible over loading of the system or removing equipment for maintenance. In this paper various aspects of intelligent reconfiguration of shipboard power systems are presented.",,POD:0-7803-7989-6,10.1109/PES.2003.1271023,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271023,,AC generators;Intelligent networks;Marine vehicles;Power generation;Power supplies;Power system faults;Power system interconnection;Power system restoration;Power systems;Thermal management,distribution networks;intelligent networks;power system reliability;ships,US navy;automatic reconfiguration;electric power systems;intelligent network reconfiguration;shipboard power systems;ships supply energy;system survivability;weapons,,5,4,,,,13-17 July 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences"Risk, reliability, cascading, and restructuring",Y. V. Makarov; R. C. Hardiman,"California Independent Syst. Oper. Corp., Folsom, CA, USA",2003 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting (IEEE Cat. No.03CH37491),20040303,2003,3,,1417,1429 Vol. 3,"Restructuring of the electric utility sector introduces unprecedented uncertainty in transmission planning and operations practices. To cover the uncertainty and to provide robust solutions, it is necessary to consider a significant number of different situations and scenarios, and to base the decision-making on characteristics reflecting all this variety. The crisis caused by inadequacy of the old methodology to the new environment becomes increasingly evident, especially in transmission planning. Adequately handling the uncertainty should be based on risk assessment, multi-scenario analysis, and probabilistic methods. The stress posed on transmission systems due to the power flow diversity is also enormous and results in shrinking reliability margins. The lack of investments and fully adequate strategies to the development of open-access transmission systems also contributes to this problem. New incentives, methodologies, indices, and standards need to be developed. This paper introduces the new risk assessment indices and comprehensive reliability assessment technology developed by Southern Company. The indices include the risk and sharpness of transmission problems and the expected energy not produced (EENP). The risk and sharpness indices allow estimating the likelihood of thermal and voltage problems and the degree of locality of these problems in different parts of the grid. The EENP reflects the annual expected energy that cannot be injected into the grid due to transmission constraints. Reliability metrics are computed for all sources of unreliability including protection group outages, islanding, and network problems. The Southern Company/EPRI TRELSS software is used as the main tool. Studies include forecasting reliability trends and goal performance, identification of ""weak elements"", in-depth analysis of reasons and mechanisms of unreliability events, impacts of hotter-than-expected weather, reliability effects of across-system power transfers, reliability impacts of budgeted transmission projects, probabilistic risk analysis of thermal and voltage problem. Southern Company has developed a unique methodology to analyze hundreds of cascading failure scenarios, determine their expected consequences, and rank the scenarios according to their severit- y and likelihood of occurrence. Cascading studies are also conducted to analyze vulnerability of the system to acts of sabotage. The paper contains examples of real-life studies and their discussions.",,POD:0-7803-7989-6,10.1109/PES.2003.1267362,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1267362,,Decision making;Power industry;Power system planning;Power system reliability;Risk analysis;Risk management;Robustness;Uncertainty;Voltage;Weather forecasting,decision making;load flow;power engineering computing;power markets;power transmission economics;power transmission planning;power transmission reliability;probability;risk analysis;uncertainty handling,electric utility sector;multiple analysis;open-access transmission system;power flow diversity;power industry restructuring;power system reliability;probabilistic method;reliability assessment technology;risk assessment;risk indices;sharpness indices;thermal problems;transmission operations;transmission planning;uncertainty handling;voltage problem,,13,27,,,,13-17 July 2003,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesTransmission reliability and security under open access,M.

No.03CH37491),20040303,2003,3,,1406,1408 Vol. 3,"This paper suggests that many of these challenges are direct result of the institutional dichotomy within the once vertically integrated industry. Namely, while the generation portion of this industry has made major progress toward becoming for profit, value-based industry, both the delivery (transmission) and the end user (distribution) remainders are left without any clear institutional support to adjust and provide their value to the end users in the changing industry. This paper shows that in order to move forward and provide some more natural ways of valuing generation, transmission, distribution and customers' willingness to respond to the changing system constraints, several issues must be resolved. Some possible institutional and technological approaches to solving the system reliability problems in the changing industry were introduced in this presentation.",,POD:0-7803-7989-6,10.1109/PES.2003.1267359,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1267359,,Economic forecasting;Electricity supply industry;Energy management;Investments;Power engineering and energy;Power system planning;Power system reliability;Power systems;Public policy;Reliability engineering,power markets;power system interconnection;power transmission economics;power transmission protection;power transmission reliability,changing industry;changing system constraints;electricity markets;interconnected electric power grid;open access;transmission reliability;transmission security;value-based industry,,0,,,,,13-17 July 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
