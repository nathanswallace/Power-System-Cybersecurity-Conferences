Discussed herein are the related objectives, strategies for new solutions implemented at California Independent System Operator (CAISO). The primary objective with these investments is to reduce the time needed to execute the end-to-end cycle of a network model change, from submittal of data to live models in production systems. The means to achieving this objective involves new technologies and realigning business processes. The cornerstone technology is a centralized model management system with flexibilities and automation for submitting, testing, and deploying new transmission system and generation project models. Within the centralized system and, equally importantly, the systems integration, a key concept is to explicitly model the time domain. Once establishing end-game systems architecture and integration strategies, implementing the transition from legacy systems is complicated by the high risk concern for the assured continuity of the core business processes that depend on the accuracy of the models.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-2212-4; POD:978-1-5386-2213-1; USB:978-1-5386-2211-7,10.1109/PESGM.2017.8274511,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8274511,California Independent System Operator (CAISO);Common Information Model (CIM);Enterprise Model Management System (EMMS),Data models;Indexes;Production;Protocols;Reliability engineering;Tools,investment;power system management,CAISO;California Independent System Operator;ISO companies;RTO companies;business processes realigning;centralized model management system;centralized system;core business processes;cornerstone technology;end-game systems architecture;end-to-end cycle;generation project models;integration strategies;legacy systems;maintenance update cycle;network model change;power system reference models;production systems;related objectives;substantial manpower;systems integration;transmission system;utility companies,,,,,,,16-20 July 2017,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesProbabilistic risk-based security assessment of power systems considering incumbent threats and uncertainties,E.

Before a system is compromised by intruders, system reliability is reduced gradually under cyberattacks. For system operators, they should perform some strategies to guarantee a high system reliability level. In this paper, the probability of compromising the system is formulated as Markov chains. The probability of compromising the system is related with the duration of PMCs. Because the duration of PMCs cannot be known exactly by system operators, this paper assumes that the duration of PMCs satisfies a given discrete distribution. In addition, outputs of generator are adjusted within ramping rates to ensure a high reliability level. The potential loss of loads works as the evaluation index. The software GAMS is employed to solve this optimization model.

The power system loads normally follow a regular time pattern and their time history, can be, utilized to provide accurate information to the estimator. In this case, the historical data has been combined with the current measurement set recursively to generate more accurate estimates, which in turn, can detect the false data attack in power systems.

Konstantelos; S. Giannelos; G. Strbac,"Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London",2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting,20180201,2017,,,1,1,"The increasing penetration of renewable distributed generation (DG) sources in distribution networks can lead to violations of network constraints. Thus, significant network reinforcements may be required to ensure that DG output is not constrained. However, the uncertainty around the magnitude, location and timing of future DG capacity renders planners unable to take fully-informed decisions and integrate DG at a minimum cost. In this paper we propose a novel stochastic planning model that considers investment in conventional assets as well as smart grid assets such as demand-side response, coordinated voltage control and soft open points (SOPs). The model also considers the possibility of active power generation curtailment of the DG units. A node-variable formulation has been adopted to relieve the substantial computational burden of the resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. A case study shows that smart technologies can possess significant strategic value due to their inherent flexibility in dealing with different system evolution trajectories. This latent benefit remains undetected under traditional deterministic planning approaches which may hinder the transition to the smart grid.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-2212-4; POD:978-1-5386-2213-1; USB:978-1-5386-2211-7,10.1109/PESGM.2017.8274536,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8274536,,Computational modeling;Cost accounting;Distributed power generation;Planning;Smart grids;Timing;Uncertainty,demand side management;distributed power generation;integer programming;nonlinear programming;power distribution control;power distribution economics;power distribution planning;power generation economics;power generation planning;smart power grids;stochastic processes;voltage control,DG output;DG units;MINLP;active power generation curtailment;conventional assets;coordinated voltage control;distribution networks;fully-informed decisions;future DG capacity;network constraints;network reinforcements;node-variable formulation;novel stochastic planning model;renewable distributed generation sources;resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming problem;smart grid assets;smart grid technology options;smart technologies;soft open points;strategic valuation;strategic value;timing,,,,,,,16-20 July 2017,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesFalse data injection attack in smart grid topology control: Vulnerability and countermeasure,T.

Therefore, it is necessary to assess and enhance cyber security for new applications in power system. As an emerging technology, smart grid topology control has been investigated in stability and reliability perspectives while the associated cyber security issue is not studied before. In successful false data injection attack (FDIA) against AC state estimation, attacker could alter online stability check result by decreasing real power flow measurement on the switching target line to undermine physical system stability in topology control. The physical impact of FDIA on system control operation and stability are illustrated. The vulnerability is discussed on perfect FDIA and imperfect FDIA against residue based bad data detection and corresponding countermeasure is proposed to secure critical substations in the system.

Luo,"State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China",2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting,20180201,2017,,,1,5,"The wide-area damping controller, which uses the wide-area signal transmitted by communication network as the input signal, is an effective measure to suppress interarea oscillations. However, communication failure may occur when communication device fault, disaster or even attack occur. It would lead to the loss of wide-area signal and may disable the wide-area damping controller (WADC). To address this problem, this paper proposes a resilient WADC by employing both a wide-area signal and a local signal as the input signals to combine the observability and reliability of input signals. Moreover, a goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP) algorithm is employed to design the resilient WADC of voltage source converter high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) transmission system for interarea oscillation. The proposed resilient GrHDP-WADC has the ability of online learning and strong adaptivity to handle the communication failure. Meanwhile, it does not need the exact model of the power system. Case study is undertaken based on a 10-machine 39-bus system with one VSC-HVDC transmission line.

The methodology then detects the erroneous measurements from the generalized studentized residuals (GSR).
