MidAmerican Energy Company, a Midwest utility, recently performed surveys of its customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and company/organization sectors. This paper presents the overall results of these surveys with primary focus on the cost results. The results of this study are compared with the results of other studies performed in high cost areas of the United States east and west coasts. This is the first ever study of this nature performed for the electrical customers in the United States Midwest region. Methodological differences in study design compared to coastal surveys are discussed. The major contribution of this paper is that particulars of Midwest customers compared to customers of coastal utilities are noted, the impact on customers with backup supply is identified, a suggested approach to enhancing customer satisfaction due to advance warning on outages is recommended, and relatively high survey response return rates are elaborated. The customer damage functions derived from the survey results are being routinely used in power delivery project justifications in annual delivery system budgeting process.",,POD:0-7803-8465-2,10.1109/PES.2004.1372892,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1372892,,Costs;Customer satisfaction;Electricity supply industry;Electricity supply industry deregulation;Electronic equipment;Maintenance;Power supplies;Power system reliability;Sea measurements;Sociology,customer satisfaction;electricity supply industry;emergency power supply;power system economics;power system faults;power system reliability,annual delivery system budgeting process;backup supply;customer satisfaction;electric power delivery systems;electrical customers;power delivery project justifications;power delivery service reliability;power supply interruptions;reliability worth assessment,,14,17,,,,6-10 June 2004,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesXcel Energy's corporate compliance council,T.

F. Wollenberg,"Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Minnesota Univ., USA","IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2004.",20050110,2004,,,6 Vol.1,,"What happens between the time a system operator runs security analysis and the system needs to be restored. Obviously this is the time of chaos when security measures have not been sufficient, or some overwhelming event occurs and the power system blacks out. This is the period of time, which most operations systems today are not prepared for. The power system is coming down around the operator and there is little he or she can do about it, in fact the operator is usually at a complete loss to know what is happening because events take place so fast. Power systems operations computers have been designed to act as little more than fast digital recorders of alarms off the SCADA system so that events can be analyzed after the fact - but little has been done to provide operators with fast graphical summaries that quickly digest the situation and allow decisions to be made during the collapse. Many years ago the idea of an intelligent alarm processor (IAP) was developed and marketed but little has been done since and the maintenance of the IAP's knowledge base was always considered one of its drawbacks. New ideas on the use of smart alarm processors coupled with fast graphical presentations must be developed so operators can retain control when the system is experiencing problems.",,POD:0-7803-8465-2,10.1109/PES.2004.1372738,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1372738,,Chaos;Computer security;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Power measurement;Power system analysis computing;Power system measurements;Power system restoration;Power system security;Time measurement,SCADA systems;power engineering computing;power system control;power system restoration;power system security,SCADA system;digital recorder;intelligent alarm processor;power system restoration;power systems operation;security analysis;smart alarm processor,,2,,,,,6-10 June 2004,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesTransmission reliability and security under open access,M.

Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2004.",20050110,2004,,,403,405 Vol.1,"In this paper the author suggests that many of the challenges presented are direct result of the institutional dichotomy within the once vertically integrated industry. Namely, while the generation portion of this industry has made major progress toward becoming for profit, value-based industry, both the delivery (transmission) and the end user (distribution) remainders are left without any clear institutional support to adjust and provide their value to the end users in the changing industry. Moreover, since the efficient and reliable operation of the electric power grid is very complex, the engineers have relied heavily over the past 20-30 years on on-line system monitoring (including state estimation), and computer methods for decision-making and system automation. These tools are difficult to develop and use for supporting efficient generation, delivery and consumption without bringing the system closer to the limits of what is possible. The lack of real economic incentives to push the system operations to its limits for efficiency reasons combined with the complexities and risks of operating close to the system stability margins has resulted in the predictable situation the industry is currently facing. Also, the she suggested that in order to move forward and provide some more natural ways of valuing generation, transmission, distribution and customers' willingness to respond to the changing system constraints, several issues must be solved. In this presentation we introduce some possible institutional and technological approaches to solving the system reliability problems in the changing industry.",,POD:0-7803-8465-2,10.1109/PES.2004.1372819,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1372819,,Computerized monitoring;Decision making;Grid computing;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Power system reliability;Power systems;Reliability engineering;Security;State estimation,electricity supply industry;power system interconnection;power system security;power transmission economics;power transmission protection;power transmission reliability,decision-making;economic incentive;electric power grid;institutional dichotomy;online system monitoring;system reliability;system stability margin;transmission reliability;transmission security;value-based industry,,0,,,,,6-10 June 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences"Design, development and commissioning of a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) laboratory for research & training",M.

C. Savulescu,"Energy Concepts Int. Corp., New York, NY, USA","IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2004.",20050110,2004,,,881,882 Vol.1,"This presentation describes an approach to the real-time detection of system conditions that may hide an approaching blackout. Two key issues are addressed: computational speed, required for on-line decision-making, and ease of interpretation of the results, i.e., the ability to see how far is the blackout without having to interpret large amounts of information and to perform complex data analysis chores. Theoretical aspects are analyzed, and a two-step stability limit evaluation paradigm is formulated. Practical aspects are also reviewed and illustrated with actual case studies taken directly from SCADA/EMS installations where the method is currently being used both in real-time and in study-mode. This technique can help system operators and reliability coordinators ""foresee whether the transmission loading progresses, or is projected to progress, beyond the operating reliability limit"". It is concluded that real-time stability assessment could easily be implemented in most of the existing SCADA/EMS installations if the two-step approach described in this presentation were implemented. First, a quick check of the stability reserve should be performed after each state estimated, power-flow solution and N-1 contingency evaluation.

V. Makarov; R. C. Hardiman; D. L. Hawkins,"California Independent Syst. Oper. Corp., Folsom, CA, USA","IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2004.",20050110,2004,,,383,395 Vol.1,"Restructuring of the electric utility sector introduces unprecedented uncertainty in transmission planning and operations practices. To cover the uncertainty and to provide robust solutions, it is necessary to consider a significant number of different situations and scenarios, and to base the decision-making on characteristics reflecting all this variety. The crisis caused by inadequacy of the old methodology to the new environment becomes increasingly evident, especially in transmission planning. Adequately handling the uncertainty should be based on risk assessment, multi-scenario analysis, and probabilistic methods. The stress posed on transmission systems due to the power flow diversity is also enormous and results in shrinking reliability margins. The lack of investments and fully adequate strategies to the development of open-access transmission systems also contributes to this problem. New incentives, methodologies, indices, and standards need to be developed. This paper introduces the new risk assessment indices and comprehensive reliability assessment technology developed by Southern Company. The indices include the risk and sharpness of transmission problems and the expected energy not produced (EENP). The risk and sharpness indices allow estimating the likelihood of thermal and voltage problems and the degree of locality of these problems in different parts of the grid. They also pinpoint the most affected facilities. The EENP reflects the annual expected energy that cannot be injected into the grid due to transmission constraints. It is used to evaluate the existing and proposed generation sites. The reliability assessment technology evaluates the expected unserved energy, system minutes of interruption, ASIDI and ASIFI indices. Reliability metrics are computed for all sources of unreliability including protection group outages, islanding, and network problems. The Southern Company/EPRI TRELSS software is used as the main tool. Studies include forecasting reliability trends and goal performance, identification of ""weak elements"", in-depth analysis of reasons and mechanisms of unreliability events, impacts of hotter-than-expected weather, reliability effects of across-system power transfers, reliability impacts of budgeted transmission projects, p- robabilistic risk analysis of thermal and voltage problems. Southern Company has developed a unique methodology to analyze hundreds of cascading failure scenarios, determine their expected consequences, and rank the scenarios according to their severity and likelihood of occurrence. Cascading studies are also conducted to analyze vulnerability of the system to acts of sabotage. The paper contains examples of real-life studies and their discussions.",,POD:0-7803-8465-2,10.1109/PES.2004.1372816,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1372816,,Decision making;Power industry;Power system protection;Power system reliability;Risk analysis;Risk management;Robustness;Uncertainty;Voltage;Weather forecasting,decision making;power transmission economics;power transmission planning;power transmission reliability;probability;risk analysis;uncertainty handling,across-system power transfer;decision-making;electric utility sector restructuring;expected energy not produced;multiscenario analysis;on risk assessment;open-access transmission system;power flow diversity;probabilistic method;probabilistic risk analysis;reliability assessment technology;transmission planning;uncertainty handling,,2,27,,,,6-10 June 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
