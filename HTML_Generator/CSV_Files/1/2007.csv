It deals with the management of commercial, operational and administrative functions pertaining to estimating fuel requirements, selection of fuel suppliers, fuel quality check, transportation and fuel handling, payment for fuel received, consumption and calculation of fuel efficiency. The results are then used for cost benefit analysis to suggest further plant improvement. At various levels, management information reports need to be extracted to communicate the required information across various levels of management. The core processes of fuel management involve a huge amount of paper work and manual labour, which makes it tedious, time-consuming and prone to human errors. Moreover, the time taken at each stage as well as the transparency of the relevant information has a direct bearing on the economics and efficient operation of the power plant. Both system performance and information transparency can be enhanced by the introduction of Information Technology in managing this area.

Not surprisingly, much of the research work in many areas of engineering was directed over the years at the advancement and application of scientific principles to the design, maintenance and improvement of the critical infrastructures in our society. Risk assessment and systematic consideration of risk in the design and operation of infrastructure is a relatively new phenomenon that emerged within the last fifty years. While many engineering disciplines still do not consider probability and statistics as essential basic knowledge for engineers, like physics for instance, consideration of risk has penetrated all engineering disciplines. In most cases, however, such considerations take the form of setting thresholds and safety margins so as to avoid ""unacceptable"" risk, where acceptability levels are typically determined by experts. In power systems for instance, the common wisdom has traditionaly been to build sufficient capacity so that the system will fail to meet demand no more than one day in ten years. Similarly, power system operation is governed to a large extent by the ""N-1 security criterion"" which requires that the system as a whole can sustain failure of any one element (e.g. generator, transmission line, transformer etc.).",1932-5517;19325517,CD-ROM:1-4244-1298-6; POD:1-4244-1296-X,10.1109/PES.2007.385877,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275643,,Design engineering;Knowledge engineering;Physics;Power engineering and energy;Power system planning;Power system security;Probability;Risk management;Statistics;Transportation,power system management;power system planning;power system security;risk management,N-1 security criterion;power system operation;power system planning;risk assessment;risk avoidance;risk management,,5,,,,,24-28 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesDo Investments Prevent Blackouts?,D.

This paper introduces a context-setting framework that organizes concepts and terminology to identify and debate interoperability issues, articulate improvements, and prioritize and coordinate actions across the electric power community.",1932-5517;19325517,CD-ROM:1-4244-1298-6; POD:1-4244-1296-X,10.1109/PES.2007.385817,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275583,adaptive systems;information technology;internetworking;software engineering;system software;systems engineering,Automation;Collaboration;Councils;Driver circuits;Electricity supply industry;Energy consumption;Forward contracts;Job shop scheduling;Power system interconnection;Terminology,power markets;power system interconnection;scheduling,GridWise<sup>TM</sup> Architecture Council;electric power community;electric supply coordination;information exchange;inter-business processes;interconnected electric power systems;market participants;scheduling,,13,16,,,,24-28 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
