Meliopoulos; G. Cokkinides; R. Fan; L. Sun; B. Cui,"School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA",2016 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM),20161114,2016,,,1,5,"This paper presents the use of a distributed dynamic state estimation, executed each cycle, to enable simultaneous cyber security and operational security. The basis of the method is: (a) data verification that detects bad data or byzantine type attacks and (b) command interception and fast authentication from the cyber security point of view (reliable detection of cyber intrusions) and from the operational reliability point of view. To ensure speed, the command authentication is done at the relay level and relay controls. Since all controls in a modern substation are exercised through a relay, this approach provides 100% coverage. The command authentication is performed by capturing each command, performing a simulation of the effects of the command via a faster than real time simulation using the real time model, and if there are no adverse effects, the command is authenticated and is allowed to proceed. This paper focuses on the approach that enables the faster than real time simulation and provides performance metrics of the method. The simulation results demonstrate the high speed-up of distributed DSE and validate the effectiveness of the command authentication and intrusion detection method based on the proposed equivalencing method.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-4168-8; POD:978-1-5090-4169-5,10.1109/PESGM.2016.7741974,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7741974,Distributed dynamic state estimation;Kron's elimination;command authentication;faster-than-real-time,Authentication;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Real-time systems;Relays;State estimation;Substations,power system reliability;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;substations,byzantine type attack;command authentication;command interception;cyber security;data verification;distributed DSE;distributed dynamic state estimation;equivalencing method;faster than real time simulation;intrusion detection method;modern substation;operational reliability;operational security;relay control;relay level,,1,,,,,17-21 July 2016,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesApproach for N-1 secure grid operation with 100% renewables,R.

One important aspect is renewable energy sources. Thereby, wind power and photovoltaic units have the biggest growth rates, even though there generated power is volatile and do not correlate to the actual load situation. As a consequence of weather conditions, the generation shifts temporally as well as geographically and makes the secure system operation more difficult. This paper presents a concept for an electrical power system supply based on 100% renewables using a vertical system operation approach to meet these effects.

The simulations of cascading failures in the CPPS with various interface and node attack strategies demonstrate that the topological centrality interface strategy shows better robustness, while the topological centrality based node attack could cause heavier damage.

Anwar; A. N.

Existing researches show that the state estimation module can be compromised by a class of data integrity attacks known as `False Data Injection (FDI)'. The stealthy FDI attack construction strategy requires the knowledge of the power system topology and electric parameters (e.g., line resistance and reactance). As an alternative to most of the existing approaches, this paper shows that stealthy attack vector can be constructed without any prior power system topological and electric parameter information and using only measurement data. Here, we demonstrate that the subspace transformation methods, e.g., Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of the measurement matrix can be used to generate a hidden attack. Next, we argue and clarify that the above claimed PCA based blind attack strategy is only valid for the measurements with Gaussian noises. In the presence of gross errors, the attacks will be detected with the traditional Bad Data Detector. Finally, we describe a technique that the attacker use to circumvent the gross error issue and construct stealthy attacks.

The goal of this limited resource attack is to cause a physical line overflow for a chosen target line that will not be observable via measurements. To determine the worst possible consequences of such a class of FDI attacks, a bi-level optimization problem is introduced wherein the first level focuses on maximizing the target line flow subject to limited attack resources constraints, while the second level formulates system response to such attacks via DC optimal power flow (OPF).

The increasing injections of energy from renewable energy sources far away from load centers have resulted in a more congested transmission grid. As the construction of new lines is costly, other options should be exploited as well. One possible solution is Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DLR), which, instead of static thermal line rating, adapts the transmission capacity based on the expected weather conditions. This results on average in higher transmission capacities. First pilot projects have proven its efficiency. This paper analyzes the potential of DLR and demonstrates how DLR can be integrated in a dispatch optimization while managing possible errors in the forecasts of the line ratings with two different approaches. Both approaches result in robust optimization problems and guarantee that there is a suitable remedial action for all realizations of forecast errors given by uncertainty sets. The first approach relies on corrective control actions that are calculated centrally, once the actual line rating is known. The second approach relies on affine policies, which directly relate the current line rating to corrective control measures. This approach can be deployed in a decentralized manner.

Among the recently discovered security challenges, the False Data Injection (FDI) has drawn great attention from power and energy, computer, and communication research community, because of its potential to manipulate measurements in state estimation (SE) without being identified by conventional bad data detection (BDD) methods. Despite the current focus on attack scheme studies in literature, the actual damage and system resilience to FDI attacks are yet to be evaluated. This paper analyzes grid resilience against FDI by formulating random FDI attacks with different magnitudes and number of false data. A steady-state AC power flow based blackout model is used to simulate misinformed system response after FDI and potential cascading blackouts in power transmission networks. Line outages, load shed, and voltage violations are evaluated on IEEE 300-bus system. Preliminary results have shown that while FDI attacks are considered severe potential threats in the smart grid, a power system can be resilient to FDI attacks in terms of blackout risk and cascading outages, yet the transient voltage stability could suffer from severe FDI attacks.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-4168-8; POD:978-1-5090-4169-5,10.1109/PESGM.2016.7741850,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7741850,,Power measurement;Power system faults;Power system protection;Power system stability;Resilience;Stability analysis;State estimation,computer network security;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system reliability;power system security;state estimation,bad data detection method;blackout model;cascading blackouts;computer communication;false data injection attacks;misinformed system response;power grid;smart grid security;state estimation measurement;steady state AC power flow,,1,,,,,17-21 July 2016,,IEEE,IEEE ConferencesQuantifying the influence of local load redistribution attack on power supply adequacy,Zhilu Ding; Yingmeng Xiang; Lingfeng Wang,"EECS Dept., The University of Toledo, OH 43606, USA",2016 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM),20161114,2016,,,1,5,"With the broader deployment of cyber technologies in electric power systems, the envisioned cyber-physical smart grid will be more vulnerable to malicious cyber attacks including local load redistribution (LR) attack which can affect the outcome of state estimation.

This vulnerability, in turn, could be exploited by attackers for financial arbitrage in a distributed electricity market. Thus, there is a growing need for attack-resilient control techniques that can fit into the distributed power system framework to ensure the global optimality of the power dispatch result in the presence of unexpected adversaries.

Such a problem is defined as an optimal tracking problem (OTP) in the literature, and an improved OTP model considering network constraints is studied in this paper. In order to circumvent the computational difficulty of a centralized solution and to save extra cost of centralized infrastructures, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based decentralized optimization algorithm is proposed. With this algorithm, the network constraints that couple different EVs' charging power together are relaxed, and the OTP model is thus decomposed into parallel single-EV charging subproblems that can be solved in a distributed manner. Case studies on a demonstration system have verified the effect of the proposed algorithm in terms of optimality and convergency. Impact of a penalty on the algorithm's convergency is also investigated, and a varying penalty strategy is suggested for better convergency.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-4168-8; POD:978-1-5090-4169-5,10.1109/PESGM.2016.7741146,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7741146,ADMM;aggregator;decentralized optimization;demand response,Computational modeling;Electric vehicles;Load management;Optimization;Power generation;State of charge;Target tracking,electric vehicles;power grids,ADMM-based decentralized demand response method;EV virtual power plant management;alternating direction method of multiplier;centralized infrastructure;electric vehicle VPP management;grid control command;improved OTP model;optimal tracking problem,,,,,,,17-21 July 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
